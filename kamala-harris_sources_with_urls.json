        "Truth-O-Meter": "True",
        "Justification": "The latest data shows that Black women in the U.S. have a maternal mortality rate of 49.5 for every 100,000 live births — nearly three times higher than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. The U.S. has the highest maternal mortality rate among economically comparable nations, data shows, with an overall rate in 2022 of 22.3 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. Reasons behind the country’s high maternal mortality numbers and its racial disparity, include a lack of health care coverage, no guaranteed paid parental leave, less robust postpartum care, and racial discrimination.",

        "Justification": "Project 2025, the 900-page conservative presidential transition document sponsored by the Heritage Foundation think tank, calls for eliminating the U.S. Department of Education, which would phase out some, if not all, federal aid to public K-12 schools. The project proposes transitioning some programs to the states over 10 years and cancels others it deems ineffective. Former President Donald Trump also supports abolishing the department. The federal government provided about 14% of public K-12 funding in fiscal year 2022, with most of the money going to programs to support disadvantaged, low-income students and students with disabilities. Although the majority of public schools receive most of their funds from state and local sources, education policy experts said that some states and districts that receive a greater share of federal aid would experience steep losses from the proposal.",

EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Can we hear it for Kelly?  (Applause.) Good afternoon, North Carolina.  (Applause.)  Oh, it’s good to be back.  It’s good to be back.  And I want to thank Kelly for your work and for your family and all that you have given to our country in service. And it is so good to be back with so many incredible leaders — (applause) — including my dear friend, Roy Cooper.  (Applause.)  You know, Roy and I served together when I was attorney general of California and he was attorney general of North Carolina.  I’ve known him for almost two decades.  And he is an extraordinary leader. And I want to also thank the extraordinary leaders who are service members and their families who are here with us this afternoon.  Thank you all.  (Applause.) You know, one of my greatest honors as vice president is to meet with our service members around the world.  I have met with our service members from NATO’s eastern flank to the Korean DMZ, and from Arizona to Florida.  And I will tell you what everybody here knows: All our service members possess an extraordinary skill, discipline, dedication, and love of country.  (Applause.)  And I know their families serve with equal dedication, and I thank you also.  (Applause.) And I say everywhere I go around the world: We are so proud that the United States military is the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen.  (Applause.) Which is why President Biden and I are proud to have passed the PACT Act — (applause) — the largest expansion of health care and benefits for veterans and military families and survivors — the largest benefit in decades.  So, thank you, again, everyone here and, in particular, our military members and your families for the service and the dedication that you have shown. So, today, we are 110 days out from the election.  (Applause.)  And while many of us have been involved with these elections for every four years, practically, nearly every time we will say, “This is the one.”  Well, this here is the one — the most existential, consequential, and important election of our lifetime.  And there is so much at stake. Last night was the latest example.  So, some of you may have heard Donald Trump’s running mate deliver remarks at the Republican National Convention. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  He talked about his life story about growing up in southwest Ohio, and it was compelling.  It’s a compelling story.  And it was not the full story.  (Laughter.) Frankly, what is very telling is what he did not talk about on that stage.  He did not talk about Project 2025 — AUDIENCE:  No. THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — their 900-page blueprint for a second Trump term.  He did not talk about it because their plans are extreme and they are divisive. In recent days, they’ve been trying to portray themselves as the party of unity.  But here’s the thing — here’s the thing.  If you claim to stand for unity, you need to do more than just use the word.  (Applause.)  You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity, and dignity.  (Applause.) You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are intent on taking reproductive freedoms from the people of America and the women of America — (applause) — trying to ban abortion nationwide, as they do, and restrict access to IVF and contraception, as their plan calls for. You cannot claim to be for unity if you try to overturn a free and fair election — (applause) — and threaten — and threaten to terminate the United States Constitution.  (Applause.) And you cannot claim to be for unity when your entire economic agenda is designed to prioritize billionaires and big corporations over the middle class.  (Applause.) We’re too busy watching what you’re doing to hear what you’re saying. And let us unpack that last point about the economy.  This race can be boiled down to a single question: Who fights for you?  Now we know whose side our president, Joe Biden, is on.  (Applause.) He grew up in a middle-class family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and he has never forgotten where he came from.  With — and I have been a firsthand witness.  With every decision he makes in the Oval Office, he thinks about how it will impact working Americans.  He understands.  (Applause.)  He understands everyday struggles because he has actually lived them. So, friends, I say the contrast between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is like night and day.  But with the selection of his running mate this week, Donald Trump is also trying to distract people.  He wants to direct attention away from his record and his Project 2025 plan to suggest that he and his running mate are going to prioritize the middle class.  But we are not buying it.  (Applause.)  We are not falling for the okeydoke. As many of you know, I am a former prosecutor.  So, I say let’s look at the facts, shall we?  (Applause.)  (Laughs.) So, Donald Trump tries to claim he brought back American manufacturing.  The fact is, under Donald Trump, America lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, and more than 1,000 factories closed under his watch.  The facts. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden and I have created nearly 800,000 new manufacturing jobs — (applause) — so much so, it’s been described as a “manufacturing boom.” Last night, we heard claims that Donald Trump is for fighting for our seniors.  Well, how the heck can you claim you fight for seniors when you intend to cut Social Security and Medicare — (applause) — which we all know is a lifeline for so many of our seniors? Let me be very clear: President Joe Biden and I will always protect Social Security and we will always protect Medicare — (applause) — all while we continue to fight to lower the cost of s- — prescription drugs for our seniors.  (Applause.)  It is President Biden and I that took on Big Pharma and finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month.  (Applause.) Who here has a family member with diabetes to know what that means?  (Applause.)  Right. But Donald Trump and his running mate intend to get rid of our $35 cap on insulin.  They will side with Big Pharma and let them make prescription drugs more expensive. Not only that, on the issue of health care, they intend to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Donald Trump and his allies tried more than 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act — 60 times — to give insurance companies back the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.  You all remember what that was like? AUDIENCE:  Yeah! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Children with asthma, women who had survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes. President Biden and I, on the other hand, have made the Affordable Care Act more strong — (applause) — because, you see, we believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.  (Applause.) Pull up the split screen.  Whereas the last administration gave tax cuts to billionaires — AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we gave tax cuts to families through the Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty in America by half.  (Applause.) And please do note: Their Project 2025 agenda would even end Head Start — AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — to take away preschool from hundreds of thousands of our children. On the issue of the cost of living, Donald Trump says he will implement a 10 percent tariff on all imported goods.  Well, understand: Independent economists agree his tariffs would increase the cost of everyday expenses for families — the cost of gas, groceries, and clothing. We, on the other hand, have taken on Big Pharma, the big banks, and big corporations to bring down costs.  (Applause.) It is we who have canceled debt, including student loan debt.  In fact — (applause).  Testify if you have received it.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  Indeed. In fact, so far, we have forgiven student loan debt for nearly 5 million Americans — (applause) — and twice as much for our public servants, including our teachers, our nurses, and our firefighters.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You’re welcome.  (Laughter.) We are also fighting to lower energy costs.  (Applause.)  We made historic investments in clean energy.  Today, America has record energy production and we are energy independent.  (Applause.)  But Trump wants to roll back our progress. Check this out: In fundraisers with Big Oil lobbyists, he wanted to trade clean energy investments that we made for you for a $1 billion campaign contribution he could get for himself. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Understand motivation. So, North Carolina, I think it is clear: If Donald Tremp — Donald Trump were to win in November, he will continue to sell out working families, he will continue to attack reproductive freedom, and he will continue to undermine our democracy. Ultimately, in this election, we each face a question.  And this herein lies our power.  The question we face is: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom — AUDIENCE:  Yes!  (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — compassion — AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and rule of law? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Or a country of chaos — AUDIENCE:  No! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — fear — AUDIENCE:  No! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and hate? AUDIENCE:  No! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We each have the power to answer this question. So, today, then, I ask, North Carolina: Are you ready to make your voices heard?  (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom?  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  DO we believe in the promise of America? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And are we ready to fight for it? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And when we fight — AUDIENCE:  We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we win. God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.) God bless you.  (Applause.) END                 2:27 P.M.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 Westover High School Fayetteville, North Carolina 2:12 P.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Can we hear it for Kelly?  (Applause.) Good afternoon, North Carolina.  (Applause.)  Oh, it’s good to be back.  It’s good to be back.  And I want to thank Kelly for your work and for your family and all that you have given to our country in service. And it is so good to be back with so many incredible leaders — (applause) — including my dear friend, Roy Cooper.  (Applause.)  You know, Roy and I served together when I was attorney general of California and he was attorney general of North Carolina.  I’ve known him for almost two decades.  And he is an extraordinary leader. And I want to also thank the extraordinary leaders who are service members and their families who are here with us this afternoon.  Thank you all.  (Applause.) You know, one of my greatest honors as vice president is to meet with our service members around the world.  I have met with our service members from NATO’s eastern flank to the Korean DMZ, and from Arizona to Florida.  And I will tell you what everybody here knows: All our service members possess an extraordinary skill, discipline, dedication, and love of country.  (Applause.)  And I know their families serve with equal dedication, and I thank you also.  (Applause.) And I say everywhere I go around the world: We are so proud that the United States military is the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen.  (Applause.) Which is why President Biden and I are proud to have passed the PACT Act — (applause) — the largest expansion of health care and benefits for veterans and military families and survivors — the largest benefit in decades.  So, thank you, again, everyone here and, in particular, our military members and your families for the service and the dedication that you have shown. So, today, we are 110 days out from the election.  (Applause.)  And while many of us have been involved with these elections for every four years, practically, nearly every time we will say, “This is the one.”  Well, this here is the one — the most existential, consequential, and important election of our lifetime.  And there is so much at stake. Last night was the latest example.  So, some of you may have heard Donald Trump’s running mate deliver remarks at the Republican National Convention. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  He talked about his life story about growing up in southwest Ohio, and it was compelling.  It’s a compelling story.  And it was not the full story.  (Laughter.) Frankly, what is very telling is what he did not talk about on that stage.  He did not talk about Project 2025 — AUDIENCE:  No. THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — their 900-page blueprint for a second Trump term.  He did not talk about it because their plans are extreme and they are divisive. In recent days, they’ve been trying to portray themselves as the party of unity.  But here’s the thing — here’s the thing.  If you claim to stand for unity, you need to do more than just use the word.  (Applause.)  You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity, and dignity.  (Applause.) You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are intent on taking reproductive freedoms from the people of America and the women of America — (applause) — trying to ban abortion nationwide, as they do, and restrict access to IVF and contraception, as their plan calls for. You cannot claim to be for unity if you try to overturn a free and fair election — (applause) — and threaten — and threaten to terminate the United States Constitution.  (Applause.) And you cannot claim to be for unity when your entire economic agenda is designed to prioritize billionaires and big corporations over the middle class.  (Applause.) We’re too busy watching what you’re doing to hear what you’re saying. And let us unpack that last point about the economy.  This race can be boiled down to a single question: Who fights for you?  Now we know whose side our president, Joe Biden, is on.  (Applause.) He grew up in a middle-class family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and he has never forgotten where he came from.  With — and I have been a firsthand witness.  With every decision he makes in the Oval Office, he thinks about how it will impact working Americans.  He understands.  (Applause.)  He understands everyday struggles because he has actually lived them. So, friends, I say the contrast between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is like night and day.  But with the selection of his running mate this week, Donald Trump is also trying to distract people.  He wants to direct attention away from his record and his Project 2025 plan to suggest that he and his running mate are going to prioritize the middle class.  But we are not buying it.  (Applause.)  We are not falling for the okeydoke. As many of you know, I am a former prosecutor.  So, I say let’s look at the facts, shall we?  (Applause.)  (Laughs.) So, Donald Trump tries to claim he brought back American manufacturing.  The fact is, under Donald Trump, America lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, and more than 1,000 factories closed under his watch.  The facts. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden and I have created nearly 800,000 new manufacturing jobs — (applause) — so much so, it’s been described as a “manufacturing boom.” Last night, we heard claims that Donald Trump is for fighting for our seniors.  Well, how the heck can you claim you fight for seniors when you intend to cut Social Security and Medicare — (applause) — which we all know is a lifeline for so many of our seniors?

        "Justification": "The statistic Vice President Kamala Harris cites derives from a limited U.S. Secret Service study published in 2019. The report didn’t find that 75% of guns used in school shootings came from unsecured locations. The study examined 25 school shootings and found that in 19 cases, the incidents were carried out using firearms from family homes. In 12 of those incidents, researchers said the weapons were readily accessible or weren’t well-secured. In four cases, guns were considered more secure, but shooters gained access anyway. Experts say more robust data is necessary to better determine the link between gun storage and school shootings. But a few studies have shown that around half of these incidents are carried out with firearms that were considered unsecured.",

                "text_body": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's new health insurance option offers lower premiums for small businesses and self-employed people, but the policies are likely to cover fewer benefits. Another caveat: if healthy people flock to the new plans as expected, premiums will rise for those who need comprehensive coverage. President Donald Trump and Labor Secretary Alex Acosta rolled out their final blueprint for \"association health plans\" on Tuesday, with Trump promising a small-business group that \"you're going to save massive amounts of money and have much better health care.\" Democrats decried it as \"junk insurance,\" and some patient groups warned it could undermine coverage for people in poor health. Republicans and some small-business groups said the administration is providing needed flexibility in the face of rising premiums. Independent experts said the administration is setting up a parallel insurance market — with different rules — alongside the Affordable Care Act, the Obama-era law Trump has been unable to repeal. Initial estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast modest changes, not a seismic shift. The new plans created under the administration's regulation incorporate the same protections for employees with pre-existing conditions that large-company plans now have, Acosta said. The Labor Department said association plans could be offered to employers in a city, county, state or a metro area that includes several states. Plans within a particular industry — real estate, for example — can be marketed nationwide. Sole proprietors and their families could join an association plan. Trump has long asserted that promoting the sale of health insurance across state lines can bring down premiums without sacrificing quality. But many experts aren't convinced because medical costs vary greatly according to geography. Currently, plans for small businesses are required to cover the ACA's 10 categories of \"essential\" benefits, from prescription drugs to maternity and mental health. Under the new approach, small employers could get coverage that comes with fewer required benefits, said Gary Claxton of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Ultimately, the idea's success depends on buy-in from plan sponsors, consumers, insurers and state regulators. No major consequences are expected for people covered by large employers. Acosta cited CBO estimates that predict a modest impact: about 4 million people covered by the plans within five years but only some 400,000 who would have been uninsured. Compare that to the total number of about 160 million covered by job-based insurance. After Republicans hit a dead end trying to repeal the Obama health law, the Trump administration has pushed regulatory actions to loosen requirements and try to lower premiums for individuals and small businesses. \"They are providing insurance options that have fewer benefits and fewer requirements than ACA-compliant plans,\" Claxton said. \"That will have a tendency to pull healthier people away because they are more attracted to plans with fewer benefits.\" Another major initiative is expected later this summer when the administration eases rules for short-term health plans lasting less than a full year that could be purchased by individuals. Those plans wouldn't have to cover people with pre-existing conditions but would offer healthy people much lower premiums. Critics say the administration's approach will draw healthy people away from the health law's insurance markets, raising the cost of coverage, which is subsidized by taxpayers. About 11 million people are covered byHealthCare.govand state markets, but the administration's priority is to try to lower premiums for an additional 7 million or so who buy their coverage directly and don't get any help from the government. State insurance regulators have been concerned about association health plans because similar plans in the past had problems with financial solvency and fraud. Administration officials said Tuesday that states and the federal government would share regulatory oversight of the plans, with states retaining their current authority. The new plans will be phased in, starting in September. A small business group called Job Creators Network welcomed the Trump administration's move. President Alfredo Ortiz said it \"will create more options, more competition, and lower costs for Main Street small businesses.\" © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He “saved” it. In thepresidential debateand in recent TV interviews, Trump and Sen. Vance, R-Ohio, have depicted the former president as selflessly choosing to protect the ACA, or “Obamacare,” during his four years in office as a way to put country over politics. “Obamacare was lousy health care. Always was. It’s not very good today. … I had a choice to make when I was president: Do I save it and make it as good as it can be? Never going to be great. Or do I let it rot? And I felt I had an obligation, even though politically it would have been good to just let it rot and let it go away,” Trump said at therecent ABCNewsdebate withVice President KamalaHarris, the Democratic nominee. “And I saved it. I did the right thing.” On NBC’s “Meet The Press” on Sunday, Vance echoed his remarks by saying Trump “actually protected those 20 million Americans from losing their health coverage” and “chose to build upon” the ACA when he “could’ve destroyed” it. Vance added: “It illustrates Donald Trump’s entire approach to governing, which is to fix problems.” Both Trump and Vance are misrepresenting the facts. As president, Trump fought to repeal and undo the ACA using executive action, legislation and lawsuits. “Trump was not successful as president in undoing the ACA, but it was not for lack of trying,” said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at KFF, a nonpartisan research group. “Trump encouraged congressional efforts to repeal and replace the ACA, and then took administrative steps to try to weaken it when the legislative route failed.” On his first day in office, Trump signed anexecutive orderproclaiming: “It is the policy of my Administration to seek the prompt repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.” He ordered agencies to “exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation” of provisions they deemed burdensome. Trump made good on his promise to pursue repeal. It was the first major item on the Republican-led Congress’ agenda in 2017. In May, the House passed the American Health Care Act, a bill to undo ACA subsidies and regulations, which was projected by the nonpartisanCongressional Budget Officeto lead to 23 million fewer people with insurance. Trumpcelebratedits passage in a triumphant Rose Garden ceremony alongside House Republicans. “Make no mistake: This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare,”Trump saidat the time. The effort fell one vote short in the Senate as three Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and John McCain of Arizona — joined Democrats to vote it down. Trump has since repeatedly criticized McCain forhis now-iconic thumbs downon the Senate floor. The legislative push was never revived, with one exception: Trump and Republicans succeeded at zeroing out the ACA’s tax penalty for most Americans who failed to buy insurance. But Trump persisted in seeking other ways to take aim at the ACA. He leaned on his executive power and his administrationslashedfunding for programs to advertise and promote ACA sign-ups. Enrollment dipped the following year, in 2018, with someblaming the cuts in funding. “He cut outreach by 90% and funding for community-based navigators by 84%, making it harder for people to sign up,” Levitt said, referring to individuals who helped Americans sign up for Obamacare plans. “He expanded short-term insurance plans that do not have to follow the ACA’s rules, including coverage of pre-existing conditions.” That fall, Democrats put a dagger in the legislative efforts to undo President Barack Obama’s signature achievement when they won control of the House, in part by campaigning on protecting the ACA. But even as other Republicans sought to abandon what they came to see as a losing political fight, Trump was undeterred. In 2020, he endorsed a lawsuit that would have wiped out the ACA entirely. The case made it all the way to the Supreme Court, and the Trump administrationformally asked the justicesto rule for the challengers and terminate the law,despite the political risksas he sought re-election. The courtupheldthe ACA the following year. By then, Trump had lost the election and Joe Biden was president. Now, as he seeks a comeback in 2024, Trump has occasionally brought up his desire to revisit the ACA battle, calling forreplacing the lawlast fall and declaring that “Obamacare Sucks.” This year, Trump’s campaign has softened its rhetoric against the ACA while stillcalling for alternatives. Trump admitted he doesn't have a replacement plan. “I have concepts of a plan,” Trumpsaidat last week's debate, adding that there are “concepts and options” for a better and cheaper system that he’ll outline “in the not-too-distant future.” Asked when Trump will roll out his plan, campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt did not provide a timeline. “As President Trump said, he will release more details but his overall position on health care remains the same: bring down costs and increase the quality of care by improving competition in the market place,\" Leavitt said. \"This is a stark contrast to Kamala Harris’ support for a socialist government takeover of our health care system which would force people off their private plans and result in lower quality care.” Harris is running on a platform of preserving the ACA,without offering specificson how she would make good on her call for expanding coverage. She has abandoned her 2019 position of puttingall Americans in Medicare. On the campaign trail, the Democratic nominee is seizing on Trump’s debate remarks. “He has ‘concepts of a plan.’ Concepts of a plan,” she said Thursday at a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina. “Which means no actual plan.” “And 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act,” she said. “So, understand what that means. He’s going to end it based on a concept and take us back when folks were suffering.” Sahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News. © 2024 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

                "text_body": "Texas has joined a growing number of states extending the period in which new moms can qualify for Medicaid insurance after giving birth, offering coverage beyond the required 60 dayspostpartum to 12 months. On Friday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed into lawHouse Bill 12, which extends the duration of Medicaid coverage provided postpartum to a full year in that state, according to the office of RepublicanstateSen. Lois Kolkhorst, sponsor of the bill. The rate of severematernal morbidity– or pregnancy and childbirth complications – hasincreased in Texas. Life-threatening pregnancy and childbirth risks can vary depending on where you live, study finds “The Texas Legislature has made a significant commitment to the life of both mothers and their children. House Bill 12 is an important step in this continuum of care for mothers as they care for their children; they can be assured they will have proper care post-partum,” Kolkhorst said in an email Thursday. “In a post-Dobbs era, the Texas Senate and House have directed significant resources to the health of women, mothers, and children with appropriations nearing $1 billion. HB 12 is one bill in a package of bills aimed to improve health and outcomes for women and their children.” Abortion is banned in Texas –one of the most restrictive abortion lawsin the developed world – which led lawmakers to debate the language used in HB 12, ultimately including anamendmentclarifying that the extended Medicaid health coverage is “for mothers whose pregnancies end in the delivery of the child or end in natural loss of the child. This does not include pregnancies that end through elective abortion.” So far, an additional 35 states and the District of Columbia have extended their Medicaid postpartum coverage to a full year after giving birth, according to data from the nonprofitKFF, formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation. New York alsoextended coveragerecently. “New York’s efforts reflect the groundswell of support for setting families on firm footing by extending postpartum coverage to a full year after pregnancy,” Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services,said in a news releaseTuesday. “The Biden-Harris Administration has prioritized maternal health and will continue to do so until all 50 states and every U.S. territory can offer pregnant women and their families the lifeline that comes with connections to health coverage.” US maternal death rate rose sharply in 2021, CDC data shows, and experts worry the problem is getting worse Maternal health advocates hope that the extensions will play small yet crucial roles in tackling the nation’s maternal mortality crisis. About1 in 3 pregnancy-related deathsoccurs about a week to one year after delivery, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. “It’s really important for people to have coverage before, during and after pregnancy, outside of pregnancy, and we know that having coverage enhances your access to care,” said Usha Ranji, associate director for women’s health policy at KFF, whose team has been tracking how many states have extended Medicaid postpartum coverage. “Medicaid actually pays for more than4 in 10 birthsnationally. So when it comes to looking at issues of maternal health, Medicaid is a big player, and that’s really the impetus behind tracking these policies,” she said. “For decades now, Medicaid coverage for pregnant people has ended in 60 days postpartum. That has been federal policy for many years. And so when the American Rescue Plan passed, it included this option for states to extend to a year.” Last year, in an effort to reduce maternal mortality and morbidity in the United States, the Biden-Harris administrationencouraged states to extend Medicaid’spostpartum insurance coverage requirements from two months after birth toa full 12 months. In that announcement, the administration called for ensuring that women giving birth are taken seriously when they raise concerns, diversifying the workforce of perinatal health-care staff, strengthening economic and social supports for patients, advancing data collection and research, and increasing access to maternal health services that include behavioral health – all part of itsmaternal health blueprintplan. Maternal and infant death rates are higher in states that ban or restrict abortion, report says As of now, according to theKFF tracker, only three states either have not extended Medicaid postpartum coverage, have not proposed plans to do so or don’t have pending legislation that passed at least one chamber: Arkansas, Idaho and Iowa. “Some states have just not taken it up because they may not want to have any expansion of Medicaid benefits. But that being said, it’s really important to keep in mind, most states have now done this and have now extended postpartum coverage for 12 months, at least,” Ranji said. “And if you look at the map, it’s not just blue states. There are red states there too, some in the South.” Medicaid postpartum coverage extension is different from full Medicaid expansion in a state. When it comes to coverage before pregnancy, Ranji said, there appear to be higher rates of coveragebefore pregnancyin states that have adopted full Medicaid expansion. As of late May, 41 states and DC have adopted full Medicaid expansion and 10 states have not, accordingto KFF. “Coverage and access to care before pregnancy is also important for a health pregnancy and postpartum period,” Ranji said. US gets D+ grade for rising preterm birth rates, new report finds As for only extending Medicaid postpartum coverage, the process for a state to do so can take some time, needingaction from state legislators and a financial commitment from the state. “The determination by a state to extend postpartum coverage may require authorization from the state legislature and likely requires the legislature to appropriate additional state funding to finance the extension of coverage for this population,” Hemi Tewarson, executive director at the National Academy for State Health Policy, which also tracksstate efforts to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage, said in an email. “Going from 60 days postpartum of coverage to 12 months has a cost that will be different for each state as it depends on each state’s federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) and how many individuals will be eligible for Medicaid due to pregnancy and their income,” she wrote. “There may also be some state policymakers who are hesitant to expand federal coverage programs.” The rate of women across the United States dying due to pregnancy or childbirth each year has been getting worse. Areport from the National Center for Health Statistics, released in March, found that the US maternal death rate for 2021 – the year for which the most recent data is available – was 32.9 deaths per 100,000 live births, compared with rates of 20.1 in 2019 and 23.8 in 2020. The total number of women who died of maternal causes in the United was 1,205 in 2021, up from previous years: 658 in 2018, 754 in 2019 and 861 in 2020. “States are also using other Medicaid policy levers to address the maternal mortality crisis such as providing reimbursement for doula and midwifery services,” Tewarson said. “Medicaid coverage of community-based providers such as doulas and midwives can improve health outcomes for pregnant and postpartum people, especially those who are low-income and people of color,” she said. “Research shows doula and midwifery care is associated with healthy birth outcomes including lower cesarean rates, fewer obstetric interventions, fewer complications, decreased likelihood of preterm birth, and more.” Tewarson added that 10 states, including Washington DC, implemented a doula Medicaid benefit and all states currently reimburse services performed by certified nurse-midwives.

                "text_body": "Advertisement The vice president’s remarks lasted roughly 35 minutes on the final night of the convention in Chicago. ByThe New York Times This is a transcript of Vice President Kamala Harris’s speech on Thursday night in which she formally accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination for the presidency. OK, let’s get to business. Let’s get to business. All right. So, let me start by thanking my most incredible husband, Doug. For being an incredible partner to me, an incredible father to Cole and Ella, and happy anniversary, Dougie. I love you so very much. To our president, Joe Biden. When I think about the path that we have traveled together, Joe, I am filled with gratitude. Your record is extraordinary, as history will show, and your character is inspiring. And Doug and I love you and Jill, and are forever thankful to you both. And to Coach Tim Walz. You are going to be an incredible vice president. And to the delegates and everyone who has put your faith in our campaign, your support is humbling. So, America, the path that led me here in recent weeks was, no doubt, unexpected. But I’m no stranger to unlikely journeys. So, my mother, our mother, Shyamala Harris, had one of her own. And I miss her every day, and especially right now. And I know she’s looking down smiling. I know that. So, my mother was 19 when she crossed the world alone, traveling from India to California with an unshakable dream to be the scientist who would cure breast cancer. When she finished school, she was supposed to return home to a traditional arranged marriage. But as fate would have it, she met my father, Donald Harris, a student from Jamaica. They fell in love and got married, and that act of self-determination made my sister, Maya, and me. Growing up, we moved a lot. I will always remember that big Mayflower truck, packed with all our belongings, ready to go — to Illinois, to Wisconsin, and wherever our parents’ jobs took us. My early memories of our parents together are very joyful ones. A home filled with laughter and music: Aretha, Coltrane and Miles. At the park, my mother would say, “Stay close.” But my father would say, as he smiled, “Run, Kamala, run. Don’t be afraid. Don’t let anything stop you.” From my earliest years, he taught me to be fearless. But the harmony between my parents did not last. When I was in elementary school, they split up, and it was mostly my mother who raised us. Before she could finally afford to buy a home, she rented a small apartment in the East Bay. In the Bay — in the Bay — you either live in the hills or the flatlands. We lived in the flats. A beautiful, working-class neighborhood of firefighters, nurses and construction workers. All who tended their lawns with pride. My mother, she worked long hours. And like many working parents, she leaned on a trusted circle to help raise us. Mrs. Shelton, who ran the day care below us and became a second mother. Uncle Sherman, Aunt Mary, Uncle Freddie, Auntie Chris — none of them family by blood, and all of them family by love. Family who taught us how to make gumbo, how to play chess — and sometimes even let us win. Family who loved us, believed in us, and told us we could be anything and do anything. They instilled in us the values they personified — community, faith and the importance of treating others as you would want to be treated. With kindness, respect and compassion. My mother was a brilliant, five-foot-tall brown woman with an accent. And as the eldest child — as the eldest child — I saw how the world would sometimes treat her. But my mother never lost her cool. She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women’s health, and she taught Maya and me a lesson that Michelle mentioned the other night. She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it. Do something about it. That was my mother. And she taught us — and she always — she also taught us, and she also taught us — and never do anything half-assed. And that is a direct quote. A direct quote. I grew up immersed in the ideals of the civil rights movement. My parents had met at a civil rights gathering and they made sure that we learned about civil rights leaders, including the lawyers like Thurgood Marshall and Constance Baker Motley, those who battled in the courtroom to make real the promise of America. So, at a young age, I decided I wanted to do that work. I wanted to be a lawyer. And when it came time to choose the type of law I would pursue, I reflected on a pivotal moment in my life. You see, when I was in high school, I started to notice something about my best friend, Wanda. She was sad at school, and there were times she didn’t want to go home. So one day I asked if everything was all right, and she confided in me that she was being sexually abused by her stepfather. And I immediately told her she had to come stay with us, and she did. This is one of the reasons I became a prosecutor: to protect people like Wanda, because I believe everyone has a right to safety, to dignity and to justice. As a prosecutor, when I had a case, I charged it not in the name of the victim, but in the name of the people, for a simple reason. In our system of justice, a harm against any one of us is a harm against all of us. And I would often explain this to console survivors of crime, to remind them: No one should be made to fight alone. We are all in this together. And every day, in the courtroom, I stood proudly before a judge and I said five words: Kamala Harris, for the people. And to be clear — and to be clear, my entire career, I’ve only had one client: the people. And, so, on behalf of the people, on behalf of every American, regardless of party, race, gender or the language your grandmother speaks. On behalf of my mother, and everyone who has ever set out on their own unlikely journey. On behalf of Americans like the people I grew up with — people who work hard, chase their dreams and look out for one another. On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on Earth, I accept your nomination to be president of the United States of America. And with this election, and — and with this election, our nation — our nation, with this election, has a precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism and divisive battles of the past, a chance to chart a new way forward. Not as members of any one party or faction, but as Americans. And let me say, I know there are people of various political views watching tonight. And I want you to know, I promise to be a president for all Americans. You can always trust me to put country above party and self. To hold sacred America’s fundamental principles, from the rule of law, to free and fair elections, to the peaceful transfer of power. I will be a president who unites us around our highest aspirations. A president who leads and listens; who is realistic, practical and has common sense; and always fights for the American people. From the courthouse to the White House, that has been my life’s work. As a young courtroom prosecutor in Oakland, Calif., I stood up for women and children against predators who abused them. As attorney general of California, I took on the big banks, delivered $20 billion for middle-class families who faced foreclosure and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first of its kind in the nation. I stood up for veterans and students being scammed by big, for-profit colleges. For workers who were being cheated out of their wages, the wages they were due. For seniors facing elder abuse. I fought against the cartels who traffic in guns and drugs and human beings. Who threaten the security of our border and the safety of our communities. And I will tell you, these fights were not easy, and neither were the elections that put me in those offices. We were underestimated at practically every turn. But we never gave up. Because the future is always worth fighting for. And that’s the fight we are in right now — a fight for America’s future. Fellow Americans, this election is not only the most important of our lives, it is one of the most important in the life of our nation. In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man. But the consequences — but the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious. Consider — consider not only the chaos and calamity when he was in office, but also the gravity of what has happened since he lost the last election. Donald Trump tried to throw away your votes. When he failed, he sent an armed mob to the U.S. Capitol, where they assaulted law enforcement officers. When politicians in his own party begged him to call off the mob and send help, he did the opposite — he fanned the flames. And now, for an entirely different set of crimes, he was found guilty of fraud by a jury of everyday Americans, and separately — and separately found liable for committing sexual abuse. And consider, consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol. His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents and anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active duty military against our own citizens. Consider, consider the power he will have, especially after the U.S. Supreme Court just ruled that he would be immune from criminal prosecution. Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails, and how he would use the immense powers of the presidency of the United States. Not to improve your life, not to strengthen our national security, but to serve the only client he has ever had: himself. And we know, and we know what a second Trump term would look like. It’s all laid out in Project 2025, written by his closest advisers. And its sum total is to pull our country back to the past. But America, we are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back. We are not going back to when Donald Trump tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. We are not going back to when he tried to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, when insurance companies could deny people with pre-existing conditions. We are not going to let him eliminate the Department of Education that funds our public schools. We are not going to let him end programs like Head Start that provide preschool and child care for our children. America, we are not going back. And we are charting — and we are charting a new way forward. Forward to a future with a strong and growing middle class because we know a strong middle class has always been critical to America’s success, and building that middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency. And I’ll tell you, this is personal for me. The middle class is where I come from. My mother kept a strict budget. We lived within our means. Yet, we wanted for little and she expected us to make the most of the opportunities that were available to us, and to be grateful for them. Because, as she taught us, opportunity is not available to everyone. That’s why we will create what I call an opportunity economy, an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and a chance to succeed. Whether you live in a rural area, small town, or big city. And as president, I will bring together labor and workers and small-business owners and entrepreneurs and American companies to create jobs, to grow our economy and to lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. We will provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs and founders. And we will end America’s housing shortage, and protect Social Security and Medicare. Now compare that to Donald Trump. Because I think everyone here knows, he doesn’t actually fight for the middle class. Not — he doesn’t actually fight for the middle class. Instead, he fights for himself and his billionaire friends. And he will give them another round of tax breaks that will add up to $5 trillion to the national debt. And all the while, he intends to enact what, in effect, is a national sales tax, call it a Trump tax, that would raise prices on middle-class families by almost $4,000 a year. Well, instead of a Trump tax hike, we will pass a middle-class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans. Friends, I believe America cannot truly be prosperous unless Americans are fully able to make their own decisions about their own lives, especially on matters of heart and home. But tonight, in America, too many women are not able to make those decisions. And let’s be clear about how we got here: Donald Trump handpicked members of the U.S. Supreme Court to take away reproductive freedom. And now, he brags about it. In his words, “I did it, and I’m proud to have done it.” Well, I will tell you, over the past two years, I’ve traveled across our country, and women have told me their stories. Husbands and fathers have shared theirs. Stories of women miscarrying in a parking lot, developing sepsis, losing the ability to ever again have children, all because doctors are afraid they may go to jail for caring for their patients. Couples just trying to grow their family, cut off in the middle of I.V.F. treatments. Children who have survived sexual assault, potentially being forced to carry a pregnancy to term. This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done. As a part of his agenda, he and his allies would limit access to birth control, ban medication abortion and enact a nationwide abortion ban, with or without Congress. And get this. Get this. He plans to create a national anti-abortion coordinator, and force states to report on women’s miscarriages and abortions. Simply put, they are out of their minds. And one must ask — one must ask, why exactly is it that they don’t trust women? Well, we trust women. We trust women. And when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly sign it into law. In this election, many other fundamental freedoms are at stake. The freedom to live safe from gun violence in our schools, communities and places of worship. The freedom to love who you love openly and with pride. The freedom to breathe clean air, and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis. And the freedom that unlocks all the others: the freedom to vote. With this election, we finally have the opportunity to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. And let me be clear — and let me be clear, after decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The border patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal. Well, I refuse to play politics with our security, and here is my pledge to you. As president, I will bring back the bipartisan border security bill that he killed, and I will sign it into law. I know — I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system. We can create an earned pathway to citizenship and secure our border. And America, we must also be steadfast in advancing our security and values abroad. As vice president, I have confronted threats to our security, negotiated with foreign leaders, strengthened our alliances and engaged with our brave troops overseas. As commander in chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. And I will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families, and I will always honor and never disparage their service and their sacrifice. I will make sure that we lead the world into the future on space and artificial intelligence. That America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century and that we strengthen, not abdicate, our global leadership. Trump, on the other hand, threatened to abandon NATO. He encouraged Putin to invade our allies. Said Russia could “do whatever the hell they want.” Five days before Russia attacked Ukraine, I met with President Zelensky to warn him about Russia’s plan to invade. I helped mobilize a global response — over 50 countries — to defend against Putin’s aggression. And as president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies. With respect to the war in Gaza, President Biden and I are working around the clock, because now is the time to get a hostage deal and a cease-fire deal done. And let me be clear. And let me be clear. I will always stand up for Israel’s right to defend itself, and I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself, because the people of Israel must never again face the horror that a terrorist organization called Hamas caused on Oct. 7, including unspeakable sexual violence and the massacre of young people at a music festival. At the same time, what has happened in Gaza over the past 10 months is devastating. So many innocent lives lost. Desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, over and over again. The scale of suffering is heartbreaking. President Biden and I are working to end this war, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination. And know this: I will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to defend our forces and our interests against Iran and Iran-backed terrorists. I will not cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong-un, who are rooting for Trump. Who are rooting for Trump. Because, you know, they know — they know he is easy to manipulate with flattery and favors. They know Trump won’t hold autocrats accountable because he wants to be an autocrat himself. And as president, I will never waver in defense of America’s security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs. So, fellow Americans. Fellow Americans. I — I love our country with all my heart. Everywhere I go — everywhere I go, in everyone I meet, I see a nation that is ready to move forward. Ready for the next step in the incredible journey that is America. I see an America where we hold fast to the fearless belief that built our nation and inspired the world. That here, in this country, anything is possible. That nothing is out of reach. An America where we care for one another, look out for one another and recognize that we have so much more in common than what separates us. That none of us — none of us has to fail for all of us to succeed. And that in unity, there is strength. You know, our opponents in this race are out there every day denigrating America, talking about how terrible everything is. Well, my mother had another lesson she used to teach: Never let anyone tell you who you are. You show them who you are. America, let us show each other and the world who we are and what we stand for: Freedom, opportunity, compassion, dignity, fairness and endless possibilities. We are the heirs to the greatest democracy in the history of the world. And on behalf of our children and our grandchildren and all those who sacrificed so dearly for our freedom and liberty, we must be worthy of this moment. It is now our turn to do what generations before us have done, guided by optimism and faith, to fight for this country we love, to fight for the ideals we cherish and to uphold the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American. So let’s get out there, let’s fight for it. Let’s get out there, let’s vote for it, and together, let us write the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. Thank you. God bless you, and may God bless the United States of America. Thank you.

                "text_body": "Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walzsat down exclusively with CNNThursday for her first interview since ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket. Just days afteraccepting the nominationat the Democratic National Convention, Harris answered wide-ranging questions from CNN’s Dana Bash, including on her economic and border policies, attacks on her race from former President Donald Trump and the call from President Joe Biden to tell her he was withdrawing from the race. Read the full transcript of the exclusive interview below. BASH:Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for sitting down with me and bringing the bus. Bus tour is well underway here in Georgia. You have less time to make your case to voters than any candidate in modern American history. The voters are really eager to hear what your plans are. If you are elected, what would you do on day one in the White House? HARRIS:Well, there are a number of things. I will tell you first and foremost one of my highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class. When I look at the aspirations, the goals, the ambitions of the American people, I think that people are ready for a new way forward in a way that generations of Americans have been fueled by — by hope and by optimism. I think sadly in the last decade, we have had in the former president someone who has really been pushing an agenda and an environment that is about diminishing the character and the strength of who we are as Americans — really dividing our nation. And I think people are ready to turn the page on that. BASH:So what would you do day one? HARRIS:Day one, it’s gonna be about one, implementing my plan for what I call an opportunity economy. I’ve already laid out a number of proposals in that regard, which include what we’re gonna do to bring down the cost of everyday goods, what we’re gonna do to invest in America’s small businesses, what we’re gonna do to invest in families. For example, extending the child tax credit to $6,000 for families for the first year of their child’s life to help them buy a car seat, to help them buy baby clothes, a crib. There’s the work that we’re gonna do that is about investing in the American family around affordable housing, a big issue in our country right now. So there are a number of things on day one. BASH:What about you? WALZ:Well, I’m excited about this agenda, too. As I said, the idea of inspiring America to what can be. And I think many of these things that the vice president’s proposing are — are — are things that we share in values. And the child tax credit’s one we know that reduces childhood poverty by a third. We did it in Minnesota. To have a federal partner in this —unbelievable, I think, in the impact that we can make BASH:You talk about — you call it the opportunity economy. You are well aware that right now many Americans are struggling. There’s a crisis of affordability. One of your campaign themes is, “We’re not going back.” But I wonder what you say to voters who do want to go back when it comes to the economy specifically because their groceries were less expensive, housing was more affordable when Donald Trump was president. HARRIS:Well, let’s start with the fact that when Joe Biden and I came in office during the height of a pandemic, we saw over 10 million jobs were lost. People — I mean, literally we are all tracking the numbers. Hundreds of people a day were dying because of COVID. The economy had crashed. In large part, all of that because of mismanagement by Donald Trump of that crisis. When we came in, our highest priority was to do what we could to rescue America. And today, we know that we have inflation at under 3%. A lot of our policies have led to the reality that America recovered faster than any wealthy nation around the world. But you are right. Prices in particular for groceries are still too high. The American people know it. I know it. Which is why my agenda includes what we need to do to bring down the price of groceries. For example, dealing with an issue like price gouging. What we need to do to extend the child tax credit to help young families be able to take care of their children in their most formative years. What we need to do to bring down the cost of housing. My proposal includes what would be a tax credit of $25,000 for first-time home buyers so they can just have enough to put a down payment on a home, which is part of the American dream and their aspiration, but do it in a way that allows them to actually get on the path to achieving that goal and that dream. BASH:So you have been vice president for three and a half years. The steps that you’re talking about now, why haven’t you done them already? HARRIS:Well, first of all, we had to recover as an economy, and we have done that. I’m very proud of the work that we have done that has brought inflation down to less than 3%, the work that we have done to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors. Donald Trump said he was gonna do a number of things, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Never happened. We did it. So now, and I — as I travel in the state of Georgia and around our country, the number of seniors that have benefited, I’ve met — I was in Nevada recently. A grandmother who showed me her receipts. And before we capped the cost of insulin for seniors at $35 a month she was paying hundreds of dollars, up to thousands of dollars a month for her insulin. She’s not doing that any longer. BASH:So you maintain Bidenomics is a success. HARRIS:I maintain that when we do the work of bringing down prescription medication for the American people, including capping the cost — of the annual cost of prescription medication for seniors at $2,000; when we do what we did in the first year of being in office to extend the child tax credit so that we cut child poverty in America by over 50%; when we do what we have done to invest in the American people and bringing manufacturing back to the United States so that we created over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs, bringing business back to America; what we have done to improve the supply chain so we’re not relying on foreign governments to supply American families with their basic needs, I’ll say that that’s good work. There’s more to do, but that’s good work. BASH:I want to get some clarity on where you stand on some key policy issues. Energy is a big one. In — when you were in Congress, you supported the Green New Deal. And in 2019 you said, quote, “There is no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.” Fracking, as you know, is a pretty big issue, particularly in your must-win state of Pennsylvania. HARRIS:Sure. BASH:Do you still want to ban fracking? HARRIS:No, and I made that clear on the debate stage in 2020, that I would not ban fracking. As vice president, I did not ban fracking. As president, I will not ban fracking. BASH:In 2019, I believe in a town hall you said — you were asked, “Would you commit to implementing a federal ban on fracking on your first day in office?” and you said, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking. So yes.” So it changed in — in that campaign? HARRIS:In 2020 I made very clear where I stand. We are in 2024, and I have not changed that position, nor will I going forward. I kept my word, and I will keep my word. BASH:What made you change that position at the time? HARRIS:Well, let’s be clear. My values have not changed. I believe it is very important that we take seriously what we must do to guard against what is a clear crisis in terms of the climate. And to do that, we can do what we have accomplished thus far. The Inflation Reduction Act, what we have done to invest by my calculation over t— probably a trillion dollars over the next ten years investing in a clean energy economy. What we’ve already done creating over 300,000 new clean energy jobs. That tells me from my experience as vice president we can do it without banning fracking. In fact, Dana — Dana, excuse me — I cast the tie-breaking vote that actually increased leases for fracking as vice president. So I’m very clear about where I stand. BASH:And was there some policy or scientific data that you saw that you said, “Oh, okay. I get it now”? HARRIS:What I have seen is that we can — we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking. BASH:Okay. Another issue, big one, is immigration. As vice president you were tasked with addressing the root causes of migration in southern countries and — HARRIS:Northern part of Central America. BASH:The northern parts of — HARRIS:Yeah. BASH:— of — of Central America that deals with, that affects the southern border of the US. During the Biden-Harris administration, there were record numbers of illegal border crossings. Why did the Biden-Harris administration wait three and a half years to implement sweeping asylum restrictions? HARRIS:Well, first of all, the root causes work that I did as vice president, that I was asked to do by the president has actually resulted in a number of benefits, including historic investments by American businesses in that region. The number of immigrants coming from that region has actually reduced since we’ve began that work. But I will say this: That Joe Biden and I and our administration worked with members of the United States Congress on an immigration issue that is very significant to the American people and to our security, which is the border. And through bipartisan work, including some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress, a bill was crafted which we supported, which I support. And Donald Trump got word of this bill that would’ve — that contributed to securing our border. And because he believes that it would not have helped him politically, he told his folks in Congress, “Don’t put it forward.” He killed the bill: a border security bill that would’ve put 1,500 more agents on the border. And let me tell you something. The Border Patrol endorsed the bill. And I’m sure — (OVERTALK) HARRIS:— and I’m sure in large part because they knew they were working around the clock and 1,500 more agents would help them. That bill would have allowed us to increase seizures of fentanyl. Ask any community in America that has been devastated by fentanyl what passing that bill would have done to address their concern and a pain they’ve experienced — BASH:So you would — so you would push that legislation again? I just want to ask ab— HARRIS:Not only push it. I will make sure that it comes to my desk and I would sign it. BASH:Just one other question about something that you said in 2019 when you first ran. There was a debate. You raised your hand when asked whether or not the border should be decriminalized. Do you still believe that? HARRIS:I believe there should be consequence. We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequence. And let’s be clear, in this race, I’m the only person who has prosecuted transnational criminal organizations who traffic in guns, drugs, and human beings. I’m the only person in this race who actually served a border state as attorney general to enforce our laws. And I would enforce our laws as president going forward. I recognize the problem. BASH:Generally speaking, how should voters look at some of the changes that you’ve made — that you explained some of here — in your policy? Is it because you have more experience now and you’ve learned more about the information? Is it because you’re running for president in a Democratic primary? And should they feel comfortable and confident that what you’re saying now is gonna be your policy moving forward? HARRIS:Dana, I think the — the — the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed. You mentioned the Green New Deal. I have always believed and I have worked on it, that the climate crisis is real, that it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time. We did that with the Inflation Reduction Act. We have set goals for the United States of America and by extension the globe around when we should meet certain standards for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, as an example. That value has not changed. My value around what we need to do to secure our border, that value has not changed. I spent two terms as the attorney general of California prosecuting transnational criminal organizations, violations of American laws regarding the passage, illegal passage of guns, drugs, and human beings across our border. My values did not change. So that is the reality of it, and four years of being vice president, I’ll tell you, one of the — the — the aspects to your point is traveling the country extensively. I mean, I’m here in Georgia, I think somebody told me 17 times since I’ve been vice president in Georgia alone. I believe it is important to build consensus, and it is important to — to — to find a common place of understanding of where we can actually solve problems. BASH:On that note, you had a lot of Republican speakers at the convention. Will you appoint a Republican to your Cabinet? HARRIS:Yes, I would. BASH:Any one in mind— HARRIS:Yes, I would. No, no one in particular in mind. I got — we got 68 days to go with this election, so I’m not puttin’ the cart before the horse. But I would. I think — I think it’s really important. I — I have spent my career inviting diversity of opinion. I think it’s important to have people at the table when some of the most important decisions are being made that have different views, different experiences. And I think it would be to the benefit of the American public to have a member of my Cabinet who is a Republican. BASH:Speaking of Republicans, I want to ask you about your opponent, Donald Trump. I was a little bit surprised, people might be surprised to hear that you have never interacted with him, met him face to face. That’s gonna change soon, but what I want to ask you about is what he said last month. He suggested that you happened to turn Black recently for political purposes, questioning a core part of your identity. HARRIS:Yeah. BASH:Any— HARRIS:Same old, tired playbook. Next question, please. (LAUGH) BASH:That’s it? HARRIS:That’s it. BASH:OK. Let’s talk about some foreign policy issues that would be on your plate if you become commander in chief. President Biden has tried unsuccessfully to end the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. He’s been doing it for months and months, along with you. Would you do anything differently? For example, would you withhold some US weapons shipments to Israel? That’s what a lot of people on the progressive left want you to do. HARRIS:Let me be very clear. I’m unequivocal and — and unwavering in my commitment to Israel’s defense and its ability to defend itself. And that’s not gonna change. But let’s take a step back. October 7, 1,200 people are massacred, many young people who are simply attending a musical festival. Women were horribly raped. As I said then, I say today, Israel had a right — has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. And we have got to get a deal done. We — we were in Doha. We have to get a deal done. This war must end— BASH:And in the meantime— HARRIS:And we must get a deal that is about getting the hostages out. I’ve met with the families of the American hostages. Let’s get the hostages out. Let’s get the ceasefire done. BASH:But no change in policy in terms of arms and — and so forth? HARRIS:No. I — we have to get a deal done. Dan — Dana, we have to get a deal done. When you look at the significance of this to the families, to the people who are living in that region — it — a deal is not only the right thing to do to end this war but will unlock so much of what must happen next. I remain committed since I’ve been on October 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Paletin — the Palestinians have security and self-determination and — and dignity. BASH:Governor Walz, the country is just starting to get to know you. I want to ask you a question about how you’ve described your service in the National Guard. WALZ:Yeah. BASH:You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed actually in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you? WALZ:Well, first of all, I’m incredibly proud. I’ve done 24 years of wearin’ uniform of this country. Equally proud of my service in a public school classroom, whether it’s Congress or — or the governor. My record speaks for itself, but I think people are coming to get to know me. I — I speak like they do. I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about — about our children being shot in schools and around — around guns. So I think people know me. They know who I am. They know where — where my heart is, and again, my record has been out there for over 40 years to — to speak for itself. BASH:And the — the idea that you said that you were in war, did you misspeak, as the campaign has said? WALZ:Yeah, I said — we were talking about in this case, this was after a school shooting, the ideas of carrying these weapons of war. And my wife the English teacher told me my grammar’s not always correct. But again, if it’s not this, it’s an attack on my children for showing love for me, or it’s an attack on my dog. I’m not gonna do that, and the one thing I’ll never do is I’ll never demean another member’s service in any way. I never have and I never will. BASH:And just one other question, because, again, this is all new. This was not — however many days ago, this was not on either of your bingo cards, especially yours. You had to clarify that you had said that you and your wife used IVF, but it turned out you used a different kind of fertility in order to have children. And then when you ran for Congress in 2006, your campaign repeatedly made false statements about a 1995 arrest for drunk and reckless driving. What do you say to voters who aren’t sure whether they can take you at your word? WALZ:Well, I’ve been very public. I think they can see — my students come out — former folks I’ve served with, and they — and they do, they vouch for me. I certainly own my mistakes when I make ‘em. The one thing I’ll tell you is I wished in this country we wouldn’t have to do this. I spoke about our infertility issues ‘cause it’s hell, and families know this. And I — I spoke about the treatments that were available to us that — that had those beautiful children there. That’s quite a contrast in folks that are trying to — to take those rights away from us. And so I — I think people know who I am. They know that record. They’ve seen that I’ve taught thousands of students. I’ve been out there. And I — I won’t apologize for speaking passionately, whether it’s guns in schools or protection of reproductive rights. The contrast could not be clearer between what we’re running against. The vice president’s position on this has been clear. And I think most Americans get it, if you’ve been through that. I don’t think they’re cutting hairs on IVF or IUI. I think what they’re cutting hairs on is an abortion ban and the ability to be able to deny families the chance to have a beautiful child. BASH:Vice President Harris, you were a very staunch defender of President Biden’s capacity to serve another four years right after the debate. You insisted that President Biden is extraordinarily strong. Given where we are now, do you have any regrets about what you told the American people? HARRIS:No, not at all. Not at all. I have served with President Biden for almost four years now. And I’ll tell ya it’s one of the greatest honors of my career, truly. He cares so deeply about the American people. He is so smart and — and loyal to the American people. And I have spent hours upon hours with him, be it in the Oval Office or the Situation Room. He has the intelligence, the commitment, and the judgment and disposition that I think the American people rightly deserve in their president. By contrast, the former president has none of that. And so — one, I — I — I am so proud to have served as vice president to Joe Biden. And, two, I am so proud to be running with Tim Walz for president of the United States and to bring America what I believe the American people deserve, which is a new way forward, and turn the page on the last decade of what I believe has been contrary to where the spirit of our country really lies. BASH:With the last decade, of course, the last three and a half years has been part of your administration. HARRIS:I’m talking about an era that started about a decade ago where there is some suggestion, warped I believe it to be, that the measure of the strength of a leader is based on you beat down instead of where I believe most Americans are, which is to believe that the true measure of the strength of a leader is based on who you lift up. That’s what’s at stake as much as any other detail that we could discuss in this election. BASH:Because we haven’t had a chance to — to talk, I’m just curious, staying on President Biden, when he called you and said he was pulling outta the race, what was that like? And did he offer to endorse you right away or did you ask for it? HARRIS:It was — it was a Sunday, so, here, I’ll — I’ll give you a little too much information. (LAUGHTER) BASH:Go for it. There’s no such thing, Madam Vice President. HARRIS:My family was staying with us. And — including my baby nieces. And we had just had pancakes and, you know, “Auntie, can I have more bacon?” “Yes, I’ll make you more bacon.” And then we were gonna sit — we were sitting down to — to do a puzzle. (LAUGH) And the phone rang. And it was Joe Biden. And — and he told me what he had decided to do. And I asked him, “Are you sure?” And he said, “Yes.” And — and that’s how I learned about it. BASH:And what about the endorsement? Did you ask for it? HARRIS:He was very clear that he was gonna support me. BASH:So when he called to tell you, he said, “I’m pulling outta the race and I’m gonna support you?” HARRIS:Well, my first thought was not about me to be honest with you. My first thought was about him to be honest. I think history is gonna show a number of things about Joe Biden’s presidency. I think history is gonna show that in so many ways it was transformative, be it on what we have accomplished around finally investing in America’s infrastructure, investing in new economics, in new industries, what we have done to bring our allies back together, and have confidence in who we are as America, and grow that alliance, what we have done to stand true to our principles including the — the — one of the most important international rules and norms, which is the importance of sovereignty and territorial integrity. And I think history is gonna show not only has Joe Biden led an administration that has achieved those extraordinary successes, but the character of the man is one that he has been in his life and career, including as a president, quite selfless and puts the American people first. BASH:I just have to ask you both about two standout moments, aside of course from the addresses that you both gave, but standout moments that were perhaps unexpected during the convention. You mentioned one of them, governor, a moment that you shared, that the world shared with your son, Gus. You were speaking. The camera caught him so incredibly proud of you, so emotional, saying, “That’s my dad.” WALZ:Yeah. I — I don’t know as a father I could’ve ever imagined that. I — I’m grateful for so many reasons to be on this ticket. But that moment — to understand what was really important, to — to have my son feel a sense of pride in me, that I was trying to do the right thing. And it was, you know, you try and protect your kids. You know it brings — it brings notoriety in things. But it was just such a visceral, emotional moment that I’m — I’m just — I’m grateful I got to experience it. And I’m — I’m so proud of him. I’m proud of him. I’m proud of Hope. I’m proud of Gwen. She’s a wonderful mother. And these are great kids. And I think the one thing is, talking about the era we’re in, is our politics can be better. It can be different. We can — we can show some of these things. And we can have families involved in this. And I — I hope that there was — I hope people felt that out there. And I hope they hugged their kids a little tighter, because you just never know. And life can be kinda hard. BASH:And last question, Madam Vice President, the photograph that has gone viral. You were speaking. One of your grand nieces that you were just talking about was watching you accept the nomination. You didn’t explicitly talk about gender or race in your speech. But it obviously means a lot to a lot of people. And that viral picture really says it. What does it mean to you? HARRIS:You know, I — listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender. But I did see that photograph. And I was deeply touched by it. And, you’re right, she’s — it’s the back of her head, and her two little braids, and — and then I’m in the front of the photograph obviously speaking. It’s very humbling. It’s very humbling in many ways. BASH:Did she talk to you about it afterwards? HARRIS:Oh, she had a lot to talk (LAUGHTER) about. She had a lot. She listened to everything. And she listens to everything. BASH:She gave you her hot takes? HARRIS:Oh, yeah, definitely. Uh-huh. (LAUGH) BASH:Madam Vice President, Governor Walz, thank you so much for your time. Appreciate it. HARRIS:Okay, thank you. WALZ:Thanks for having us. HARRIS:Thank you, Dana. Thank you. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Can we hear it for Mike D?  (Applause.) Hello, family and friends.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  Oh, it’s good to be back in North Carolina.   Oh, it’s good to see everyone.  (Applause.)  Thank you. Oh, it’s good to see everyone.  Good afternoon.  Everyone, please have a seat, if you have a seat.  (Laughter.)  Please have a seat. Mike D, I have to — so, Mike D’s Barbecue — let me tell you one of the biggest fans of Mike D’s barbecue: my husband, Doug Emhoff.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.) And — and thank you, Mike, for sharing your story.  And — and I’m just so sorry for what your family has been through, but you have, out of an incredible tragedy, done so much for the community, and you are such a role model.  So, thank you, Mike, for everything you do.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you. And good afternoon to everyone here.  Thank you to all of the incredible leaders with us today, including my friend, the governor, Roy Cooper.  Where is he?  (Applause.)  Here with his daughter. Every time I land in North Carolina, I — just literally coming down the stairs of Air Force Two, I will shout to Roy Cooper, “What number is it, Roy?”  (Laughter.)  And today, he shouted, “16,” which is the number of times I’ve been in this beautiful state since I’ve been vice president.  (Applause.)  Every time. I want to thank your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein.  (Applause.)  He’s doing incredible work.  He’s going to be an extraordinary governor.Representatives Adam[s], Manning, Foushee, and Nickel, thank you all for your support, for your friendship, for your leadership.  (Applause.)Chair Thomas of the Wake County Board of Commissioners, thank you for all that you do.  (Applause.)And to all the leaders that are here today, including the students and instructors here at Wake Tech North, thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.)So, thank you all.So, listen, this election, I do strongly believe, is about two very different visions for our nation: one, ours, focused on the future; and the other, focused on the past.We see that contrast clearly in many ways, including when it comes to how we think about the economy.So, our country has come a long way since President Biden and I took office.  At that time, we sadly remember the millions of Americans that were out of work.  We were facing one of the worst economic crises in modern history.And, today, by virtually every measure, our economy is the strongest in the world.  (Applause.)We have created 16 million new jobs.  We have made historic investments in infrastructure, in chips manufacturing, in clean energy.  And new numbers this week alone show that inflation is down under 3 percent.  (Applause.)And as president of the United States, it will be my intention to build on the foundation of this progress.Still, we know that many Americans don’t yet feel that progress in their daily lives.  Costs are still too high.  And on a deeper level, for too many people, no matter how much they work, it feels so hard to just be able to get ahead.As president, I will be laser-focused on creating opportunities for the middle class that advance their economic security, stability, and dignity. Together, we will build what I call an “opportunity economy” — (applause) — “an opportunity economy” — an economy where everyone can compete and have a real chance to succeed; everyone, regardless of who they are or where they start, has an opportunity to build wealth for themselves and their children; and where we remove the barriers to opportunity so anyone who wants to start a business or advance their career can access the tools and the resources that are necessary to do so.  (Applause.)I will focus on cutting needless bureaucracy and unnecessary regulatory red tape and encouraging — (applause) —  and encouraging innovative technologies while protecting consumers and creating a stable business environment with consistent and transparent rules of the road.As president, I will bring together labor with small businesses and major companies to invest in America, to create good jobs, achieve broad-based growth, and ensure that America continues to define the future and lead the world.  (Applause.)And key — key to creating this opportunity economy is building up our middle class.  It is essential.  (Applause.)The middle class is one of America’s greatest strengths, and to protect it, then, we must defend basic principles — such as, your salary should be enough to provide you and your family with a good quality of life. (Applause.)Such as, no child should have to grow up in poverty.  (Applause.)Such as, after years of hard work, you should be able to retire with dignity.  (Applause.)And you should be able to join a union if you choose.Building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency, because I strongly believe when the middle class is strong, America is strong.  (Applause.)So, in the weeks to come, I will address in greater detail my plans to build an opportunity economy.  And, today, I will focus on one element that’s on the minds of many Americans as they pay their bills at the kitchen table or walk the aisles of a grocery store, and that is lowering the cost of living.  (Applause.)So, every day across our nation, families talk about their plans for the future; their ambitions; their aspirations for themselves, for their children; and they talk about how they’re going to be able to actually achieve them financially.  Because, look, the bills add up — food, rent, gas, back-to-school clothes, prescription medication.  After all that, for many families, there’s mo- — not much left at the end of the month.I grew up in a middle-class household.  For most of my childhood, we were renters.  My mother saved for well over a decade to buy a home.  I was a teenager when that day finally came, and I can remember so well how excited she was.  I kind of understood what it meant, but — we called her “Mommy” — Mommy was so excited, it just made us excited that she was so excited.  (Laughter.)Later in college, I worked at McDonald’s to earn spending money.  Well, some of the people I worked with were raising families on that paycheck.  They worked second or even third jobs to pay rent and buy food.  That only gets harder when the cost of living goes up.When I am elected president, I will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans.  As president, I will take on the high costs that matter most to most Americans, like the cost of food.We all know that prices went up during the pandemic when the supply chains shut down and failed, but our supply chains have now improved and prices are still too high.A lo- — a loaf of bread costs 50 percent more today than it did before the pandemic.  Ground beef is up almost 50 percent.  Many of the big food companies are seeing their highest profits in two decades.  And while many grocery chains pass along these savings, others still aren’t.Look, I know most businesses are creating jobs, contributing to our economy, and playing by the rules, but some are not, and that’s just not right, and we need to take action when that is the case.  A- — (applause) —As attorney general in California, I went after companies that illegally increased prices, including wholesalers that inflated the price of prescription medication and companies that conspired with competitors to keep prices of electronics high.  I won more than $1 billion for consumers.  (Applause.)So, believe me, as president, I will go after the bad actors.  (Applause.)  And I will work to pass the first-ever federal ban on prou- — pricegauging[gouging] on food.  (Applause.)My plan will include new penalties for opportunistic companies that exploit crises and break the rules, and we will support smaller food businesses that are trying to play by the rules and get ahead.  (Applause.)We will help the food industry become more competitive, because I believe competition is the lifeblood of our economy.  More competition means lower prices for you and your families.  (Applause.)Now compare what Donald Trump plans to do.  He wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax on everyday products and basic necessities that we import from other countries.That will devastate Americans.  It will mean higher prices on just about every one of your daily needs: a Trump tax on gas, a Trump tax on food, a Trump tax on clothing, a Trump tax on over-the-counter medication.And, you know, economists have done the math.  Donald Trump’s plan would cost a typical family $3,900 a year.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  At this moment when everyday prices are too high, he will make them even higher.As president, I’ll attack and take on the issue of the cost of health care.  As attorney general, I took on insurance companies and Big Pharma and got them to lower their prices.  (Applause.)And together with President Biden, we’ve gone even further.  We capped the price of insulin at $35 a month and the total cost — (applause) — and the total cost of prescription drugs at $2,000 a year for seniors.We let Medicare negotiate lower drug prices for seniors.And just yesterday — and just yesterday, we announced that we are lowering the price by up to 80 percent for 10 more lifesaving drugs.  (Applause.)AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And I pledge to continue this progress.  I’ll lower the cost of insulin and prescription drugs for everyone with your support, not only our seniors — (applause) — and demand transparency from the middlemen who operate between Big Pharma and the insurance companies, who use opaque practices to raise your drug prices and profit off your need for medicine.Two months ago, I announced that medical debt will no longer be used against your credit score.  (Applause.)  And I will work, as president, with states like here in North Carolina — Roy Cooper, thank you again — to cancel medical debt for more and more — millions more Americans.  (Applause.)As for Donald Trump, well, he wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act —AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — which 45 million Americans rely on.  Forty-five million Americans rely on it for health care.That would take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny people with preexisting conditions.  We all remember what that was —AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We’re not going back!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and we’re not going back.AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’re not going back.  We’re not going back.AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And — and remember — and this is why we’re not going back, because we do remember — (laughter) — he tried to cut Medicare every year he was president, threatening a program that tens of millions of seniors count on.And according to his Project 2025 agenda, he intends to undo our work to bring down prescription drugs — the cost of prescription drugs and insulin costs.Well, we’ve come too far to let that happen.  (Applause.)So, we’re not going back on that, and let’s talk about the cost of housing.  (Applause.)So, now, the housing market can be complicated, but, look, I’m not new to this issue.  As state attorney general, I drafted and helped pass a homeowner bill of rights, one of the first in America.And during the foreclosure crisis, I took on the big banks for predatory lending with many of my colleagues, including Roy Cooper, and won $20 billion for California families when I was attorney general.  (Applause.)So, I know how to fight for people who are being exploited in the housing market, and I know what homeownership means.  It’s more than a financial transaction.  It’s so much more than that.  It’s more than a house.Homeownership and what that means — it’s a symbol of the pride that comes with hard work.  It’s financial security.  It represents what you will be able to do for your children.  (Applause.)And sadly, right now, it is out of reach for far too many American families.  There’s a serious housing shortage in many places.  It’s too difficult to build, and it’s driving prices up.As president, I will work in partnership with industry to build the housing we need, both to rent and to buy.  We will take down barriers and cut red tape, including at the state and local levels.  (Applause.)And by the end of my first term, we will end America’s housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class, and we will do that together.  We will do that together.  (Applause.)And — and we will make sure those homes actually go to working- and middle-class Americans — (applause) — not just investors.  Because, you know, some corporate landlords — some of them buy dozens, if not hundreds, of houses and apartments.  Then they turn them around and rent them out at extremely high prices, and it can make it impossible, then, for regular people to be able to buy or even rent a home.Some corporate landlords collude with each other to set artificially high rental prices, often using algorithms and price-fixing software to do it.  It’s anticompetitive, and it drives up costs.  I will fight for a law that cracks down on these practices.  (Applause.)We also know that as the price of housing has gone up, the size of down payments have gone up as well.  Even if aspiring homeowners save for years, it often still is not enough.So, in addition, while we work on the housing shortage, my administration will provide first-time homebuyers with $25,000to help with the down payment on a new home.  (Applause.)We can do this.  We can do this, all to help more Americans experience the pride of homeownership and the financial security that it represents and brings.So, that’s my plan.  But here’s what Donald Trump would do.If his Project 2025 agenda is put into effect, it will add around $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.He’s got it backward.  We should be doing everything we can to make it more affordable to buy a home, not less.  (Applause.)Finally, there’s one more way I will help families deal with rising costs, and that’s by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.  (Applause.)  Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax cut, and we will do this by restoring two tax cuts designed to help middle-class and working Americans: the Earned Income Tax Credit — (applause) — and the Child Tax Credit — (applause) — through which millions of Americans with children got to keep more of their hard-earned income.We know this works and has a direct impact on so many issues, including child poverty.  We know it works.So, as president, I’ll not only restore that tax cut but expand it.  We will provide $6,000 in tax relief to families during the first year of a child’s life.Now, think what that means.  (Applause.)  Think what that means.  That is a vital — vital year of critical development of a child, and the costs can really add up, especially for young parents who need to buy diapers and clothes and a car seat and so much else.  And we will do this while reducing the deficit.Compare my plan with what Donald Trump intends to do.  He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts year after year and he plans to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars, even as they pull in record profits.  And that’s on top of the $2 trillion tax cut he already signed into law when he was president, which, by the way, overwhelming- — overwhelmingly went to the wealthiest Americans and corporations and exploded the national deficit.You know, I think that if you want to know who someone cares about, look who they fight for — look who they fight for.  (Applause.)Donald Trump fights for billionaires and large corporations.  We — I will fight to give money back to working- and middle-class Americans.  (Applause.)So, I’ll end with this.  Two days ago, Donald Trump was here in North Carolina.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  He said he was going to talk about the economy — (laughter) — I think you all watched; you know what I’m about to say — but he offered no serious plans to reduce costs for middle-class families, no plan to expand access to housing or health care.  And that, actually, I think, for most of us, was not surprising because we already know his plans.  We know the Project 2025 agenda.So, there’s a choice in this election: Donald Trump’s plans to devastate the middle class, punish working people, and make the cost of living go up for millions of Americans; and, on the other hand, when I’m elected president, what we’ll do — (applause) — what we will do to bring down costs,increase the security and stability financially of your family, and expand opportunity for working- and middle-class Americans.  (Applause.)So, now — now — now is the time to chart a new way forward.  (Applause.)  Now is the time to chart a new way forward, to build —AUDIENCE:  A new way forward!  A new way forward!  A new way forward!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  A new way forward, yes.  A new way forward.AUDIENCE:  A new way forward!  A new way forward!  A new way forward!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  To build — to build an America where everyone’s work is rewarded and talents are valued, where we work with labor and business to strengthen the American economy, and where everyone has the opportunity not just to get by but to get ahead.So, I thank you, North Carolina.  We’re going to get this done — (applause) — and with your help.  God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  God bless you.  (Applause.)END                 2:54 P.M.

                "text_body": "Advertisement Once he ran for office, Mr. Vance, Donald J. Trump’s new running mate, embraced Mr. Trump’s false theories about voter fraud and elections. ByCharles Homans Reporting from Milwaukee In the last days of the 2016 presidential campaign, when Donald J. Trumppreemptively accused Hillary Clintonof stealing an election that many assumed Mr. Trump would lose, his critics included his future running mate. “If he decides to make this election about how it was stolen from him, then folks are going to be angry and they will be less engaged in the political process than they otherwise would be,” J.D. Vance warned in a CNN interview that October. He said he hoped that Mr. Trump, if he lost, “acts magnanimous.” But after Mr. Trump did, in fact, lose and contest an election, four years later, Mr. Vance took a very different position. “We have a fake country right now,” Mr. Vance — at the time, a Senate candidate vying for Mr. Trump’s endorsement in a Republican primary —told a reporter for The Vindicator, a newspaper in Mahoning County, Ohio, in October 2021. “There were certainly people voting illegally on a large-scale basis.” Mr. Vance hascandidly acknowledgedhis very publicjourneyfrom outspoken critic of Mr. Trump — who he once speculated might be“America’s Hitler”in a text message to a former roommate — to an enthusiastic supporter of the former president, who named Mr. Vance his vice-presidential candidate on Monday. As Mr. Trump’s running mate, the most consequential part of this journey may be his transformation from a critic of Mr. Trump’s false 2016 claims about election fraud to a defender of his efforts to overturn the 2020 results. In recent interviews, Mr. Vance has argued that the 2020 election was compromised by a combination of censorship and influence by social media companies and mid-election changes to voting procedures in key states, and that it should have been settled by Congress’s deciding between competing slates of electors. The comments seem to give credence to the so-called fake electors plan — the strategy that Trump’s allies used to try to prevent the transfer of power to Mr. Biden after his victory. It ultimately led a mob to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in search of Vice President Mike Pence, who had refused to go along with the plan. In February, Mr. Vancetold George Stephanopoulos of ABC Newsthat were he in the office at the time, he would have acted differently. “If I had been vice president, I would have told the states like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others that we needed to have multiple slates of electors,” he said. “And I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there. That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that’s what we should have done.” The claim that changes in voting rules related to the coronavirus pandemic were illegal has not been upheld in any court except partially in Wisconsin, which has an elected Supreme Court. The conservative majority of that court in 2022 ruled that the use of drop boxes for early voting was not in accordance with state law, but the decision wasreversedby a new liberal majority on the court this month. Ben Ginsberg, a longtime Republican election lawyer who has been a vocal critic of Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, argued that Mr. Trump had ample opportunity to prove his case in court. Mr. Trump’s claims were ultimately rejected or declined a hearing by courts in every state where the campaign brought a legal challenge. “We had the open debate through all the court cases, and we’ve continued to have the open debate for the past three years,” Mr. Ginsberg said. “Still, nobody’s found evidence of fraudulent results.” Neither the Trump campaign nor Mr. Vance’s Senate office responded to requests for comment. By the time of the 2020 election, Mr. Vance had publicly distanced himself from his early skepticism of Mr. Trump. But he did not publicly countenance the former president’s claims of a stolen election until he began his campaign for Senate the next summer. In early interviews, he demurred when questioned about the election.Asked by a reporterfor Time whether it had been stolen, he allowed only that it had been “unfair.” But like many Republican primary elections in 2022, Ohio’s Senate race quickly became a referendum on Mr. Trump’s 2020 election claims. “It was crowded. Nobody really stood out. And he was struggling,” David Pepper, the former chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, said. “They all knew that Trump’s endorsement would end the primary.” Mr. Vance’s most formidable challenger was Josh Mandel, the state treasurer, who, like Mr. Vance, had remade himself as a pro-Trump hard-liner, and who early on staked out a position of absolute fealty to the former president’s claims. Shortly after Mr. Vance’s interview with Time, Mr. Mandel appeared on the podcast of Stephen K. Bannon, the former Trump adviser, anddenounced Mr. Vanceas a “total establishment squish” and “Mitt Romney Jr.” He ridiculed Mr. Vance’s refusal to embrace Mr. Trump’s election claims. That February, a pollster for a pro-Vance super PAC, Protect Ohio Values, took the unusual step of publicly releasing a memo detailing Mr. Vance’s struggles to break through in the race. The pollster, Tony Fabrizio, argued that Mr. Vance faced an image problem with Republican voters driven by “the perception that he is anti-Trump,” and noted that a majority of likely Republican primary voters in Ohio “say the election was stolen from Trump.” Two months later, when the Republican candidates faced one another in a televised debate, Mr. Vance joined Mr. Mandel and other Republican candidates indeclaringthat “I think the election was stolen from Trump.” In theinterview with The Vindicator, Mr. Vance accused Meta’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, who through the Center for Tech and Civic Life had spent millions of dollars supporting local election offices, of “buying up local boards of elections in battleground states” in order to help Mr. Biden win. “If a billionaire can go and buy up votes in our biggest geographies and tilt an election, transform who can be president, it’s really, really dangerous stuff,” he said. More recently, Mr. Vance has mostly argued for a version of the alternate electors scenario. He has said that Congress should have held an open debate over the merits of Mr. Trump’s claims of voter fraud, rather than certifying the election for Mr. Biden based on the vote count in the states, as vice presidents have always done. “Do I think Joe Biden would still be president right now? Yeah, probably,” hetold the New York Times columnist Ross Douthatin June. “But at least we would have had a debate.” Mr. Ginsberg noted that theSupreme Court rulinglast year in the case of Moore v. Harper effectively closed the door on long-shot legal scenarios involving referring elections back to the state level. He suggested that Mr. Vance, a graduate of Yale Law School, was leaning on specious legal theories as “a safe rhetorical place to go in an interview that was in part an audition for the vice presidency.” An earlier version of this article did not clearly describe Mark Zuckerberg’s relationship to the Center for Tech and Civic Life. He and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were the organization’s largest donors in 2020. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.

                "text_body": "U.S. AbortionLandscape Advertisement The Republican Senate candidate in Ohio fielded questions in a Fox News town hall event that also included his Democratic rival, Representative Tim Ryan. ByMaggie Astor J.D. Vance, the Republican nominee for Senate in Ohio, said Tuesday evening that he would accept the results of his election — while also saying he stood by his false claims that the 2020 election had been “stolen.” “I expect to win,” Mr. Vance said in a town-hall-style event hosted by Fox News, before adding: “But, of course, if things don’t go the way that I expect, I’ll support the guy who wins and I’ll try to be as supportive as I possibly can, even accepting that we’re going to disagree on some big issues.” But when one of the hosts, Martha MacCallum, noted that he had previously said the 2020 election was stolen from Donald J. Trump, whose endorsement propelled him to the nomination, Mr. Vance replied, “Yeah, look, I have said that, and I won’t run away from it.” He referred to state court rulings concerning elements of the way Pennsylvania had conducted its election, but none of those rulings called the results into question. The town hall event was split between Mr. Vance and his Democratic rival in the Senate race, Representative Tim Ryan, with each candidate appearing separately and fielding questions from the moderators and the audience. Mr. Ryan distanced himself from the left wing of the Democratic Party on inflation and abortion, something he has done often as he tries to win a Senate seat in a state that has shifted significantly to the right in recent years. While denouncing Republican abortion bans as extreme and inhumane, he said he believed third-trimester abortions should be allowed only in medical emergencies. That distinguishes him from many other Democrats, who have said that abortion should always be a decision between women and their doctors and that the government should play no role in regulating it. (Third-trimester proceduresare very rare, accounting for less than 1 percent of abortions in the United States.) In promoting the ability ofDemocrats’ Inflation Reduction Actto live up to its name, Mr. Ryan highlighted its natural gas provisions, saying they would bring construction jobs to Ohio, while calling for tax cuts like an expanded child tax credit in the short term. He explicitly aligned himself with Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, whose objections limited the size of the legislation and ensured that natural gas provisions accompanied its clean energy measures. Mr. Vance, in his own discussion of inflation, called for Congress to “stop the borrowing and spending” — without specifying the spending cuts he wanted — and alluded to more oil and gas production. On abortion, he said he believed that “90 percent of abortion policy” should be set by state governments, while also indicating that he supported the 15-week federal banproposed by Senator Lindsey Grahamof South Carolina.

                "text_body": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Donald Trump's new running mate,Sen. JD Vance, wasn't yet a member of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, when an angry mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, chanting \"hang Mike Pence\" and seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But that hasn't stopped Vance, R-Ohio, from promoting Trump's unfounded claims about that election, won by President Joe Biden, and insisting lawmakers could have fought the results. “If I had been vice president, I would have told the states, like Pennsylvania, Georgia and so many others, that we needed to have multiple slates of electors, and I think the U.S. Congress should have fought over it from there,” Vance saidinan interviewwithABC Newsthis year. “That is the legitimate way to deal with an election that a lot of folks, including me, think had a lot of problems in 2020. I think that’s what we should have done.” Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the UCLA School of Law, said it's the states that are empowered to contest their results and proffer slates of electors — not the vice president. \"There were single slates of electors that were submitted from each state, and there was no reasonable basis to challenge the legitimacy of those slates of electors,\" he said. In interviews, Vance has repeatedly argued there were problems with the 2020 election, pointing to pandemic-related election rule changes like mail voting expansions, which Republicans protested and didn't seek to rally their voters around, and a social media company’s decision toblock a storyabout Hunter Biden, the president's son, weeks ahead of the election. “Whether you think Hunter Biden is as major an issue as I do or disagree, in American democracy you let the voters decide. That was a way in which the basic democratic will of America was obstructed. I don’t see any reason to think that Dominion voting machines switched ballots, but there was a breakdown in democratic will,” Vance recentlytold The New York Times. In the same interview, Vance also defended his questioning of the 2020 results. “I think that challenging elections and questioning the legitimacy of elections is actually part of the democratic process. When Trump says the election was stolen and people say he was wrong, I say, 'Fine, we can argue about that.' When they say, 'He’s threatening the foundation of American society,' I can’t help but roll my eyes,\"he said. Vance began advancing false claims about the 2020 race before he was elected to the Senate in 2022. “There were certainly people voting illegally on a large-scale basis,” Vancesaid in a 2021 interview with The Vindicator newspaper of Youngstown. There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud, despite countless audits, investigations and examinations of the 2020 election. The Trump campaign and its allies filed dozens of lawsuits to try to affect the results, but they were unsuccessful in large part because they had no evidence. Vance also falsely claimed that Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg spent $420 million “buying up local boards of elections in battleground states of mostly Democratic areas” to “tilt” the vote in Biden’s favor. In reality, Zuckerberg donated to two groups that funneled money to election officials to accommodate pandemic-related changes to the elections. Election officials used the grants allocated by nonprofit groups to buy masks and pens for poll workers, among other things. Whether or not the Trump-Vance ticket wins in November, Vance will be asked to vote to certify the election results in his role as a senator. “Sure, if it’s a free and fair election, I will accept the results standard, whoever wins,\" Vance said on CNN in May.

I'm Dana Bash in Washington, where the state of our union is wishing all the moms out there a happy Mother's Day.This coming week, we could see the final stages of Donald Trump's hush money trial. And, in neighboring New Jersey, Trump vented his anger late Saturday afternoon ahead of expected testimony from the star witness in the case, former Trump fixer Michael Cohen.On the West Coast, President Joe Biden is looking to capitalize on his opponent's predicament, calling Trump -- quote -- \"clearly unhinged\" during a closed-door fund-raiser.But Biden faces growing political problems of his own after his stark new ultimatum this week to Israel in an interview on CNN, vowing to block some U.S. military aid to Israel if it invades the Gazan city of Rafah. Israel seems undeterred, ordering 300,000 Gazans out of Rafah.It all leaves Biden with strained support among Democrats and a middle ground that seems to have left no one happy, something Trump tried to seize on at his rally.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  Crooked Joe's action is one of the worst betrayals of an American ally in the history of our country.

He's going to be joining former President Trump at an event in Cincinnati this week on Wednesday.Thank you so much for being here. It's nice to see you in person.I want to start with the Mideast and President Biden announcing on Wednesday that he would block some shipments of U.S. weapons if Israel invades Rafah.SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH):  Sure.BASH:  He's frustrated after months of telling the Israeli prime minister to be more targeted. He doesn't think that Netanyahu is changing course. And the president believes that too many civilians have been killed with U.S. weapons. Is that a fair concern?VANCE:  Well, first of all, Dana, let me say, happy Mother's Day to you and all the moms watching.BASH:  Thank you.VANCE:  But, to answer your question, I think there are two big problems with what the Biden administration is doing.First of all, it's a fundamentally incoherent policy. On the one hand, they're saying too many Palestinian civilians have been killed. With the other hand, they're depriving the Israelis of the precision-guided weapons that actually cut down on civilian casualties.So, if you're worried about Palestinian casualties, the stated policy here actually doesn't make a ton of sense. And I think the bigger problem here if we zoom out is, look, and I hate to say this, but America is not good at micromanaging wars in the Middle East.Joe Biden has been president for four years, but he's really presided over, as a senator and a vice president, many of the biggest disasters we have had in foreign policy in the Middle East over the last 40 years. And I think that our attitude vis-a-vis these Israelis should be, look, we're not good at micromanaging Middle Eastern wars.The Israelis are our allies. Let them prosecute this war the way they see fit.BASH:  The argument that President Biden has made, we understand, in private, and he's done it in public, is that he is trying to get the Israeli prime minister to learn the lessons of wars in the U.S.[09:05:00]By the way, it was a Republican who was president, George W. Bush.VANCE:  Sure.BASH:  The way that the U.S. responded in Afghanistan, and, of course, the war in Iraq, to learn the lessons. And he doesn't believe that the prime minister is doing so.VANCE:  Yes, so first of all, I completely concede, by the way, it was a Republican president in Iraq, though with Democratic buy-in from people like Joe Biden.BASH:  Sure.VANCE:  But I think, to learn the lessons...BASH:  And it's not just Iraq. It's Afghanistan.VANCE:  ... of multiple conflicts -- look, we have not been good at this, and that's been a bipartisan failure. By the way, it's one of the reasons why I think Donald Trump was a good foreign policy president. He departed from that wisdom.But to answer your question, Dana, and, look, the fundamental problem here is, the Israelis have a goal in mind. Hamas started a war by murdering a large number of Israeli civilians, and now that they're 80 percent defeated, they're throwing up their hands and saying uncle.Now, yes, Palestinian civilian casualties is a real issue, and our heart certainly goes out to them. We have to ask ourselves, why are Palestinian civilian casualties so high? It's because Hamas started the war, and now they hide behind Palestinian civilians.So, if you want to learn the lessons, I think, of the last 40 years, the most important thing is, we have to defeat Hamas as a viable military organization. You're never going to defeat the ideology of Hamas, but you can root out those commanders, those final military- trained battalions, and I think we should empower the Israelis to do it.But the final point here, Dana, I think this is very important, our goal in the Middle East should be to allow the Israelis to get to some good place with the Saudi Arabians and other Gulf Arab states. There is no way that we can do that unless the Israelis finish the job with Hamas.If they can't even do that, the attitude in the Middle East will be, you can't trust these guys, they're not pursuing their own national security. So we have got to let them finish this job, and I think, hopefully, on the other end of it get to a new era in the Middle East.BASH:  I want to ask about something that Donald Trump said in -- on social media.VANCE:  Sure.BASH:  He said: \"What Biden is doing with respect to Israel is disgraceful. If any Jewish person voted for Joe Biden, they should be ashamed of themselves. He's totally abandoned Israel.\"You tweeted that Donald Trump was right about that.So, I just want to be clear. You think that Jewish people who voted for Joe Biden should be ashamed of themselves?VANCE:  Well, what I think, Dana, is that people should look at the record here and recognize that Donald Trump has actually been really good for the state of Israel.We had peace and prosperity in our country, and we had a very stalwart ally of the Israelis. Now Joe Biden is president. The Israelis have been attacked. You have got these terrible campus protests with a lot of antisemitic overtones all over our country, and you also have him trying to micromanage the Israeli response to them being attacked.Do I think it's reasonable to look at this situation and say that, if you're a Jewish American who cares about the state of Israel, who cares about these antisemitic riots, and say you should be on the side of Republicans in 2024 because they govern effectively on some of the issues that you care about, I think it's a totally reasonable argument to make.And I think that Donald Trump's going to keep on making it.BASH:  Historically, the notion of saying to Jews, you should put Israel first and what happens in Israel first, and not sort of consider them American citizens first, has been used as an antisemitic trope.Do you recognize that there, and perhaps that language isn't exactly on point when you're talking about something that is very, very -- it's like a tinderbox right now? VANCE:  We have to remember, Donald Trump is very direct here.BASH:  But you said he was right.VANCE:  And he hasn't singled out Jewish Americans. He singled out a lot of people for voting for Joe Biden, and suggesting they have got to wake up and elect him as president in 2024.So I don't think there's any effort to single out Jewish Americans. And just on that particular question about tropes, I mean, look, we know that Jewish Americans and non-Jewish Americans care about our ally Israel. We know that Jewish Americans and non-Jewish Americans care a lot about these ridiculous protests.I actually have a friend of mine whose brother was graduating from Columbia who had the graduation ceremony canceled, and that's a non- Jewish person who cares a lot about these antisemitic protests. So I think the fact that Donald Trump is talking about Jews in that particular context does not mean he doesn't think the same lessons apply to a whole host of American citizens.BASH:  Yes, because he did say that any Jewish person who voted for Joe Biden should be ashamed of themselves.I want to move on.VANCE:  But he made similar comments about a lot of different groups of people, Dana. I don't think anybody could look at the presidency in the conduct of Donald Trump and say, this is a person who's somehow antisemitic.And I think, whether you're Jewish or not, you should be looking at the record of Joe Biden and saying...BASH:  He had dinner with Nick Fuentes, who is an avowed antisemitic.VANCE:  Dana -- Dana, you should look at the record of Joe Biden and recognize that, whether you're Jewish or not, his presidency has been a disaster for the American people.BASH:  I want to ask about what we saw this past week, and it's going to continue this week, the trial in New York.Adult film actress Stormy Daniels testified about her allegation of a sexual encounter with Donald Trump. Now, after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape in 2016, you tweeted -- quote -- \"Fellow Christians, everyone is watching us. When we apologize for this man, lord help us.\"[09:10:08]Now, you have since deleted that tweet. Do you still feel that way about Donald Trump's sexual indiscretions?VANCE:  Well, first of all, Donald Trump is not on trial for sexual indiscretions. This is a sham trial where they're saying his misdeed is that he violated the law, that he committed a crime. You can't throw somebody in prison in the middle of a presidentialelection because you think that he did something bad 10 years ago. So I think we have to separate these arguments from the actual criminal trial that's attempting to, in my view, Dana, interfere in a presidential election.But, look, my view on Donald Trump, I have been very clear on this, is, look, I was wrong about him. I didn't think he was going to be a good president, Dana, and I was very, very proud to be proven wrong. It's one of the reasons why I'm working so hard to get him elected.And I think the contrast here is really from Joe Biden, who delivered chaos on the world stage, rising cost of living here at home, to Donald Trump, who delivered peace and prosperity to the American people and to the world. That's a very, very simple contrast to make.And I think Republicans just have to hammer that message home, because we have got the winning horse here and we have got the winning message.BASH:  And I just want to be clear. The notion of -- you're right that he's not on trial for alleged sexual indiscretions. It's something else.But do you think that he should be treated differently because he was a former president, because he is running for president? And if he's convicted, do you still support him?VANCE:  Well, I don't think he should be treated differently at all, Dana, but I certainly think he is being treated differently.The only thing that Alvin Bragg, the New York prosecutor's team thinks Donald Trump did wrong is that he ran for president in 2024 and he looks to be on the cusp of victory. That is the only thing that this is ultimately about.If you look at the underlying argument of the case, they can't even identify what it is that Donald Trump did. They said he committed a paperwork violation in the service of a crime, but they won't even specify the crime that he allegedly committed.And I think that when you look at all of these attacks on Donald Trump, you have to be honest with yourself and say, this is not about law and this is not about justice. This is about the fact that President Joe Biden has a failed record as commander in chief and leader of this country, and the Democrats can't talk about that.So what they're doing is putting these trials out there and saying, focus on this, not on the fact that the world is on fire and the fact that you have gotten poorer under the presidency of Joe Biden.BASH:  Yes, a lot of things to unpack there. We're almost out of time.VANCE:  Sure.BASH:  I just want to look forward. 2024, this election year that we're in, will you commit to acceptingthe results of this year's election?VANCE:  Look, Dana, I totally plan to accept the results of 2024.I think that Donald Trump will be -- the victory. And if it's a free and fair election, Dana, I think every Republican will enthusiastically accept the results. And, again, I think those results will show that Donald Trump has been elected president, been reelected president.I think that this question, though, it's interesting, Dana, because we have to be willing, as Democrats did in 2000, as Democrats have done in the past, and certainly as Republicans did in 2020, is, if you think there were problems, you have to be willing to pursue those problems and try to prosecute your case.BASH:  And...VANCE:  And, certainly, if we have a free and fair election, I will accept the results.BASH:  Even if Joe Biden wins?VANCE:  Sure. If it's a free and fair election, I will accept the results, Dana, whoever wins.BASH:  OK. Senator, thank you so much.VANCE:  Thanks, Dana.BASH:  Appreciate you coming in.VANCE:  Great.BASH:  Coming up:  Did President Biden's very public shift on Israel in an interview with our own Erin Burnett make the issue even harder for him politically? Senator Chris Murphy is here live.Plus: a headache in the 2024 campaign, how RFK Jr. is causing one, not just for Joe Biden, but, it seems, Donald Trump. Our panel will weigh in.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:18:21]BASH:  Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION.President Biden spent months trying to navigate the push and the pull from fellow Democrats when it comes to Israel. But, this week, he put conditions on U.S. aid to Israel for the first time. Is he isolating himself from both sides of the Middle East debate?Here with me now to discuss that is Senator Chris Murphy, a member of the Foreign Relations Committee and a critic of the way Israel has been carrying out its war in Gaza.Thank you so much for being here.SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT):  Yes.BASH:  Do you support what President Biden told Erin Burnett, that he is blocking some military aid to Israel and won't support them, will block more if in fact Israel goes into Rafah more aggressively?MURPHY:  I do support President Biden's decision. And let me tell you why.President Biden is learning the mistakes of U.S. military campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. What we learned in both of those efforts was that you cannot defeat a terrorist ideology, you cannot defeat a terrorist movement with military force alone.In Afghanistan, we spent 20 years there. And, ultimately, we were so cavalier about civilian casualties that we made the Taliban stronger. And we ultimately lost that engagement to the Taliban.And so, in Israel, what Joe Biden is telling the Israelis is, we will be partners with you, but you have to understand that the pace of civilian casualties, the amount of humanitarian disaster there is in the long run going to make Hamas stronger, is going to make it more likely that Israel will be attacked again, and is going to make other terrorist organizations that have designs to attack the United States stronger.So we will be partners in this fight, but in the situation of Rafah, we cannot have a military invasion of Rafah that ends up in tens of thousands of additional civilians dying. That would be bad for Israel from a moral and a strategic standpoint.[09:20:07]BASH:  So, the counterargument that is not just coming from Republicans, but also some Democrats, your fellow Democrat from Pennsylvania, John Fetterman, and he actually said withholding military -- quote -- \"demonstrates to Hamas that they're winning the P.R. war and they're exploiting America's compassion.\"So does he have a point there that what the president said is actually kind of doing the opposite of what you just warned of and that actually is helping Hamas?MURPHY:  So, we have no obligation to write a blank check of military support to any of our allies. We have a right, as a sovereign nation with our own independent security concerns, to make sure that, when we are partnering with an ally, that we are partnering with a winning strategy.Our own national security experts tell us that this is a generation, -- this moment will have a generational impact on the growth of terrorism around the globe. I want Hamas gone. I don't want them to ever have the ability to hit Israel again. I worry that the number of civilians that are dying are ultimately going to provide permanent recruiting material to Hamas and Hamas will remain a threat for years to come to Israel.BASH:  The reality, though, is that Hamas is still not just a military sort of wing in Gaza. They are the governing body in Gaza.And I guess my question is, on that, if you were president or if you were completely directing the war, even in Israel, how would you eliminate Hamas in a way that's different and more effective than what you're describing?Because the understatement of the year is, it ain't easy.MURPHY:  Well, let's just make sure that we understand there is a limit to American influence on Israeli politics.BASH:  But what do you think Israel should be doing?MURPHY:  So I think Israel should be open to bringing in the Palestinian Authority to be a transition governance structure inside Gaza.BASH:  But how does that eliminate Hamas?MURPHY:  That is something that -- well, listen, I think every intelligence expert has already come to the conclusion you are not going to be able to eliminate Hamas, right?You are -- there is going to continue to be a resistance movement to the state of Israel. And the question is, it going to be weaker or stronger after 13,000 to 15,000 kids are killed inside Gaza? My argument is that, right now, the prospects are that it is going to be stronger.And so, if Israel makes a more concrete commitment to a future Palestinian state, I think right now or within the next several months, I think that is one of the most important things it can do to try to dry up the recruitment material that right now is very live for Hamas or follow-on organizations to Hamas.And that's one of the things that worries me is that we do not see that commitment being made, which I think is essential for the survival of a Jewish state in the Middle East, something that I, Democrats and Republicans are deeply desirous of.BASH:  The State Department released a report late on Friday that said -- quote -- it was -- quote -- \"reasonable to assess\" that U.S. weapons have been used by Israeli forces in ways -- quote -- \"inconsistent with international law.\"But the report stopped short of reaching an actual conclusion on whether Israel has violated humanitarian law. I know you have been pushing for this report for months. Are you satisfied?MURPHY:  Listen, I think the report could have gone further. But it does, I think, accurately explain the complexity of this war.And let's just also be clear about that. Yes, I believe that there have been some very disastrous decisions on proportionality made by the Israeli military. If there's one Hamas fighter in an apartment building, it is not worth it to kill 50 innocent civilians.But it is also true, as my friend Senator Vance said, that Hamas is hiding itself inside...BASH:  That was going to be my next question.MURPHY:  Yes, inside civilian populations. They are hiding themselves in hospitals, inside schools. There's no doubt that this war could end tomorrow if Hamas surrendered.If Hamas really cares about the people of Gaza, they could decide to end this war right now. There's a cease-fire proposal on the table that they could accept. So, I am certainly willing to call out Israel when I think that they have made strategic and moral mistakes in this war.But a lot of the focus here tends to be on Israel, when we should be calling out Hamas for the attacks that began this war, the way in which they have violated the rules of engagement, and the fact that the quickest route to end this war is for Hamas to surrender and protect the people of Gaza.BASH:  Just on the raw politics of this, do you think that, when the president said what he said to Erin Burnett this week, that what ended up happening is, he tried to kind of -- I don't want to take away from what he tried to do on policy, but just on the politics, that it ended up kind of pleasing no one? Is that a potential problem?[09:25:12]Or do you think that is what he said and did is helpful for his detractors on the left?MURPHY:  Listen, I think the president makes decisions when it comes to the security of this country based upon what he thinks is going to protect the country.BASH:  But the reality is, it's been hurting him on the left. Would this help?MURPHY:  Yes, but I don't mind the fact that the president isn't paying attention to the politics.And I think, frankly, when you're being a good leader, you are often upsetting people on the right and the left. And so President Biden advertised himself when he ran for office as someone who would often play it down the middle, who would not pay attention to the extremes of the debate and would just do what he thought was right for the country and what the broad middle of the country wants.And I actually think that's where the broad middle of the country is. I think the broad middle of the country wants to support Israel's ability to destroy Hamas, but is very concerned about the fact that there are so many kids dying, that, for the last week, there's been no humanitarian assistance getting into the country.I think the president really is squarely where the middle of this country is on this conflict.BASH:  And I guess part of the problem -- we're out of time -- is that the humanitarian assistance, some of it that got in, was taken by Hamas away from its own people.MURPHY:  That's right. That's right.BASH:  Senator, thank you.MURPHY:  Thank you.BASH:  I appreciate you being here.Up next:  Both campaigns are shifting their strategies on Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Why?My panel, including a man RFK wanted to be his V.P., is next.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:31:07](BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP:  RFK Jr. is a Democrat plant, a radical left liberal who's been put in place in order to help crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of the United States, get reelected.So, Republicans, get it out of your mind that you're going to vote for this guy because he's conservative. He's not.(END VIDEO CLIP)BASH:  Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION.That was former President Donald Trump going after independent presidential candidate Robert -- Robert F. Kennedy Jr.My panel is here now.I mean, Scott Jennings, the idea that he didn't just send out a -- something written, he sat in front of a camera and said to camera what he just said, I mean, it's not even a tell. It's like a megaphone saying he's concerned.SCOTT JENNINGS, CNN SENIOR POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes.Well, and he mentioned he's not a conservative. And I think that the Trump people are thinking it's going to be easy to recover some of those folks who currently tell pollsters there with RFK because he has been a fringe liberal lunatic for most of his life.And there's an audience in American politics, maybe small, but there's an audience who believes there's a conspiracy for everything. I mean, there are people out there who believe that the stop sign in their neighborhood was put there by the Rothschilds, the Gettys and Colonel Sanders. I mean, that's the group.And he needs to recover those people. And they're easy to get, when you consider what RFK has said during the course of his career. This is an easy thing for them to do to close that door.BASH:  Welcome, former Senator Scott Brown.Tell me about -- you're friends with RFK Jr. Tell me about his entreaty to you to be his running mate.FMR. SEN. SCOTT BROWN (R-MA):  Well, he asked me to be his vice president. Certainly, it's something I considered.I think -- respectfully, Scott, I think he's smart, intelligent, obviously has -- he's very passionate. You may not agree with him, but he believes...(CROSSTALK)BASH:  Why'd you say no?BROWN:  It's not -- it's not -- we have so many differences, and I'm a Republican. But I wished him well, certainly.That being said, there's a reason why Trump and Biden are going after him, Biden behind the scenes trying to challenge the ballot access. He's going to have ballot access. It's the first question I asked him. Are you going to have ballot access? He says, absolutely.He's on Michigan, California. Michigan in the last election was 11,000 votes, OK, that was separated them. He's going to get way more than 11,000 votes.BASH:  You're a Republican. Do you think he's going to play spoiler?BROWN:  You know, I think he's -- it's hard. That's the question du jour. It depends on the state.I think, in Michigan, it hurts Biden, quite honestly, and I think it helps Trump. In other states, it may be a little bit different. But he's going to get more than 11,000 votes, so he's going to play. He's polling at 12 percent, and he's probably going to be on the debate stage.(CROSSTALK)BASH:  Can I just say, as you come in, that I was talking to somebody who's working on the Democratic side to try to stop RFK Jr.KAREN FINNEY, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  Yes. BASH:  And the question I had was, if Trump is worried, why are you so worried? And the answer was, we just want -- we don't know how this is going to play out.FINNEY:  Yes.BASH:  And we just want to define him and we want to try to pull votes away, no matter where they're coming.FINNEY:  Sure, 100 percent.So, earlier this week, I mean, the story about the brain worm was very disconcerting, not just because of what he said about what -- how it impacted his cognitive abilities, which, as someone who has had brain surgery, that is a very serious question that Americans should get answers to if they're going to make him -- think they're going to vote for him for president.But the fact that his answers shifted three or four times throughout the week kind of showed that they're not ready for prime time. It is not unreasonable to ask that question. And then, secondarily, he admitted in interviews this week that -- he said, yes, Joe Biden can't win if I'm in the race.So his motivations are quite clear. And he is pandering to that part of the base that he thinks he's getting or the Trump base that he thinks he's getting. He also said this week he'd consider pardoning January 6 rioters.[09:35:01]So, again, he's -- this is craven politics, trying to play for both sides. And I think the Trump campaign is realizing what we realized quite some time ago. It's unclear. He's probably going to pull from both.ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR:  He doesn't also have a strategy to actually get to 270. So he may get more than 11,000 votes in Michigan, but just winning Michigan is not enough to actually win the presidency.You have to have ballot access on enough -- in enough states to actually get to 270. And so the question is, if you're a candidate and you're running and you can't get to 270, then what are you? You are a spoiler alert, because you literally can't win the presidency.The other reason why both sides are paying attention to him is because he's inconsistent on his issues. So, one day, he's feeling this way about abortion. Then, the next day, he's feeling that way. And so in a media cycle where sometimes it's hard for voters to track all the issues, if you hear one ad about him when -- on one day, you may say, this is my guy.But, actually, when -- if he got into office, he would do something totally different on the other side.(CROSSTALK)BROWN:  Yes, but, Dana, may I...BASH:  Sure.BROWN:  First of all, he's going to get on more than just one state. And, obviously, it'll go to a House of Representatives if neither -- any of the candidates get to the 270.But people don't like Trump or Biden. And they're looking for an alternative. And he comes across as authentic, as vibrant, and you may not agree with him, but he's an alternative to the two...(CROSSTALK)JENNINGS:  I mean, is that how you run a campaign? You don't agree with anything I say, but you have to vote for me?BROWN:  It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter.(CROSSTALK)BROWN:  It doesn't matter. He's going to get a substantial amount of votes.JENNINGS:  I'm not disputing that.BROWN:  OK?JENNINGS:  But the question is about the Trump campaign strategy. Here.He is -- Trump can easily knock this down. I'm less certain that Biden can knock it down. One of the things RFK did this week was go out and take an extremist position on abortion. And I'm not sure Biden can go out and refute that.I mean, but Trump can go out and refute some of the things RFK is doing. And so I think it's just simply easy for Trump to get his people back, easier than it will be for Biden.(CROSSTALK)FINNEY:  Can I...BASH:  Go ahead.FINNEY:  Just quickly on abortion, Biden can absolutely refute extremist positions on abortion.JENNINGS:  He's going to take a moderate position on abortion?FINNEY:  No, I said he can easily refute an extremist position on abortion.JENNINGS:  Do you think what RFK said was extremist or -- OK. FINNEY:  Well, you said -- I'm using your words. You said extremist.JENNINGS:  I'm asking you what you think. You're a Democrat. What do you think?FINNEY:  I think it is inconsistent, and that concerns me deeply, because this is an issue for women in this country right now, where either you understand that a woman needs to be able to make that decision or you think government should. And there's no waffling on that.(CROSSTALK)JENNINGS:  Well, he said -- that's what he said. That's what he said.FINNEY:  No, he said both things.ALLISON:  Both things.FINNEY:  He said both things.ALLISON:  I think what Joe Biden is able to do is actually take the position that the majority of Americans, both Democrats and Republicans, believe on the issue of abortion. And in the last two election cycles, '22 and '23, we have seen that to be true.And they have been aligned with the Democrats on that.BROWN:  Listen, we -- in New Hampshire, we did it right. We -- they all work together. It's something that I think should be left to the states. And in New Hampshire, we have it right.BASH:  Before we go...(LAUGHTER)BASH:  ... we're going to make a hard turn, but an important turn.FINNEY:  Yes.BASH:  I know you wanted to talk about something that is coming up that is near and dear to your heart and something we cover on the show a lot.FINNEY:  Yes.So, Brittney Griner's book, \"Coming Home,\" was -- is out this week. And she details beautifully, horribly the conditions under which she was held in Russia, gives a real viewpoint into what Russia under Putin, the dehumanization that she endured, the lack of what it is to live in a dictatorship, quite frankly, and just how she maintained her own humanity.But I think it's a real -- it's important. I give her so much credit for being willing to dive back into that pain, so that we can remember, when we're talking about Russia and Putin and what he wants to do with Ukraine and when he's on the march, read that book and understand what life under him would be like.BASH:  Thank you for sharing. Thank you so much for being here.ALLISON:  Happy Mother's Day.(CROSSTALK)BASH:  Thank you. Thank you.And you, to Gail, and to your wife, to everybody.Up next:  She blazed a trail to become the first woman to lead FEMA, and it wasn't always easy.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRISWELL:  So, it was always a balance between demonstrating your confidence and your competence with being called the B-word, right?BASH:  Were you called that?CRISWELL:  Many times.(END VIDEO CLIP)(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:44:00]BASH:  Welcome back to STATE OF THE UNION.After a wave of deadly tornadoes, we traveled to Oklahoma with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to see the devastation firsthand. It's the latest in my series \"Badass Women of Washington.\"(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)CRISWELL:  Your home is OK? Your family?This is just incredible to see that.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes.BASH (voice-over):  Total destruction along the path of devastating tornadoes that ripped through these rural Oklahoma communities.CRISWELL:  Well, I'm so sorry that you're going through this.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Yes. It's the only grocery store in our county, the only grocery store in our city.CRISWELL:  Wow.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  And we want to built back. It's 20 percent of our income.BASH:  We traveled with FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell to survey the damage from multiple tornadoes in Marietta and Sulphur, Oklahoma, talking to local officials...CRISWELL:  Nice to see you.BASH:  ... to help assess their needs.CRISWELL:  Do you have any questions for me?UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Not right now.[09:45:00]CRISWELL:  Yes.UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I'm sure I will later.CRISWELL:  Yes.(LAUGHTER)CRISWELL:  I get it. It's a lot right now.BASH:  Before Criswell, only men ran FEMA.(on camera):  You are the 12th FEMA administrator.CRISWELL:  Yes.BASH:  First woman in the role.How does that impact the way that you do your job?CRISWELL:  You know, when I first was asked to come in and do this job, I didn't really think about it.But I like to go back and reflect on the first week that I was here. And one of my younger female employees had come up to me after a meeting. And she said: \"A year ago, there were zero women in my chain of command between me and the president of the United States.\"BASH (voice-over):  Now there are more women in emergency management at all levels.CRISWELL:  So, just quickly, like, what's your biggest concern?BASH:  In Oklahoma, at Criswell's first meeting with state leaders about the tornadoes, women were in charge.CRISWELL:  Will they be able to go to school or so much impact that they're not going to be able to go to school?UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  They're likely not to be able to go to school.CRISWELL:  So that means that those children won't have food.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  Correct.CRISWELL:  I know, as I was coming up in my career, it was always a balance between demonstrating your confidence and your competence with being called the B-word, right?BASH (on camera):  Were you called that?CRISWELL:  Many times.BASH:  To your face?CRISWELL:  Yes. Yes.BASH:  And what'd you say?CRISWELL:  I just pushed forward with, this is why I'm doing this. This is why I need to be here.I go back a lot to even how I got started.BASH (voice-over):  She got started as a firefighter.CRISWELL:  I had actually had somebody talk me into joining the military and joining the Air National Guard, because I wanted to go back to college, and I didn't really have a means.I was about to become a single mother. At the time, they said that they had bomb loading and firefighting. And so I went and I interviewed with both, and the bomb loaders looked really bored. The firefighters were having a lot of fun. And I said, I will give that a shot.BASH:  She was only the sixth woman firefighter in Aurora, Colorado.(on camera):  How old were your kids?CRISWELL:  So, I was 25 when I joined. And so my kids were -- they were 3 and 5.BASH:  So that must have been hard, just like it is for a single mom doing lots of different jobs.CRISWELL:  Mm-hmm. Yes. It's a balance, right?BASH (voice-over):  After 9/11, Criswell deployed with the Colorado Air National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar.CRISWELL:  We do have this first case of coronavirus.BASH:  She later managed New York City's emergency response there during the darkest days of the COVID pandemic.GOV. KEVIN STITT (R-OK):  Administrator.CRISWELL:  Nice to see you in person.STITT:  Yes.CRISWELL:  Sorry it's under these circumstances.STITT:  Well, we appreciate you coming.BASH:  Her work then and now transcends politics and party.STITT:  When there's a disaster and there's people in need, we're all Americans. And that's, I think, the administrator's attitude. These are federal agencies that we have to work with regardless of who's in the White House.CRISWELL:  This kind of a partnership, this is absolutely critical to make sure we bring the right people into these communities to help with their specific needs.Look at that. This is -- this is the building where they had the one loss of life.BASH (on camera):  Actually looking at this, hard to imagine that anybody survived. It's a miracle.CRISWELL:  I know.BASH (voice-over):  She talks to locals trying to clean up and cope.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  And I'm screaming: \"There's a tornado, everyone inside.\" I was screaming, \"Jackson, please come in.\"And I blinked and he was gone.CRISWELL:  I'm so sorry.UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:  (INAUDIBLE) The hardest thing I have ever had to do was shut that door.BASH (on camera):  And what, as FEMA director, do you learn when you come to a place like this that, that you can't learn on a Zoom, on a phone call with your deputies who are here on the ground?CRISWELL:  You can't feel that emotion. You can't feel the heartache.BASH:  Why is that so important?CRISWELL:  Because it helps me get rid of the red tape. It helps me break down bureaucracy in order to ensure that it's more than numbers. It's people.BASH (voice-over):  Eliminating red tape at FEMA has been a top goal for Criswell.Earlier this year, she succeeded in pushing through the biggest overhaul of the agency's relief programs in two decades, streamlining the process to get help to disaster victims and more money to survivors faster.CRISWELL:  I wanted us to really understand what it meant to put people first.BASH:  This job keeps her constantly on the road, but her other job, a grandmother and mother of two sons, keeps her centered.CRISWELL:  I deployed right after the 9/11 attacks. My orders said \"for an undetermined amount of time.\"I always wondered how much that was going to impact them. I remember that I brought them with me to my confirmation hearing. When they were with me that day, and you could see how proud they were and how successful they have both become, it really just gave me a really warm feeling as a mother.(END VIDEOTAPE)[09:50:02]BASH:  Our thanks to Administrator Criswell.And happy Mother's Day to her, as well as all the mothers here at STATE OF THE UNION, our excellent executive producer, Rachel Streitfeld, producers Cassie McNamara, Christie Johnson, Melissa Giaimo, plus Ruby Williams and Angelica Flores (ph), to my own mother, Francie -- I love you so much, mom -- and, of course, to all the mothers out there watching at home.Up next, remembering a Washington giant, but, more importantly, a good man.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[09:55:13]BASH:  The world lost a very special man this week.Jack Quinn, former White House counsel, passed away at the age of 74. I had the privilege of knowing him as more than just a D.C. lawyer. I knew him as a friend, a husband, who loved my dear friend Susanna, his wife of 17 years, with all his heart, and a father who adored his eight children and 12 grandchildren.In recent years, he used his skills and experience as a Washington powerhouse to represent families of those killed on September 11. The organization 9/11 Families United released a statement mourning Jack and crediting him with helping pass the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act in 2016 -- quote -- \"Jack had the courage to speak truth to power and fight for what is right.

                "text_body": "OpinionRoss Douthat Credit...Jeff Dean/Associated Press Supported by ByRoss Douthat Opinion Columnist News update: Donald Trump announced that he hasselectedJ.D. Vance as his running mate. In May, Vance sat down for a long conversation with Ross Douthat, an Opinion columnist. In 2016, J.D. Vance’s best-selling memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” made him one of America’s leading interpreters of Trumpism, offering a personal narrative of populism’s origins in working-class disarray. In 2024, as a first-term United States senator from Ohio, Vance is arguably America’s leading Trumpist: a staunch ally of Donald Trump, a leading critic of the establishment consensus (or what remains of it) in both foreign and domestic politics, a potential vice-presidential candidate and a likely populist agenda-setter for a second Trump term. The Vance of eight years ago was read with appreciation and gratitude by Trump opponents looking for a window into populism. The Vance of today is despised and feared by many of the same kind of people. His transformation is one of the most striking political stories of the Trump era, and one that’s likely to influence Republican politics even after Trump is gone. I've known Vance since before he assumed either of these identities. For this conversation, I spoke to him about how he sees his own evolution, his relationship to the American elite and to Trump himself, his views on populist economics and America’s support for Ukraine. He also offered a combative (and, to my mind, fundamentally unsupported and unpersuasive) defense of Trump’s conduct after the 2020 election. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. J.D., the first time I realized that “Hillbilly Elegy,” was going to be a phenomenon was in August 2016. I was in Rockland, Maine, in a cozy little tourist bookstore. I tried to buy the book for my wife, and they said, “Oh, we had four or five copies and they all sold out in the last week.” Looking back, almost certainly most of the people who bought the book in that little bookstore were educated liberals baffled by the Donald Trump phenomenon,who liked your book not just for its literary merits but also because they felt like here was a guy who was sympathetic to people voting for Trump but who was also at that time vehemently opposed to him. So I thought it would be interesting for you to imagine yourself talking to a big “Hillbilly Elegy” fan from 2016, and talk him through how your perspective has changed. There was one really good thing about “Hillbilly Elegy,” meaning the response to it: People were actually genuinely trying to understand something about a part of the country they didn’t understand. But there was something that wasn’t so good, which is that people were looking for some interpretive lens for Trump’s voters that never really asked them to challenge their priors or to rethink what they felt about those people. And I realized that I was being used as this whisperer of a phenomenon that some people really did want to understand but some people didn’t. And the more that I felt like, not an explainer and a defender, but part of what I thought was wrong about the liberal establishment, the more that I felt this need to go very strongly away from it. Let me give you one story: In 2018, I was invited to an event hosted by the Business Roundtable, an organization of C.E.O.s. Many people there I like and admire; many people there who hate my guts —— Not back then. Not back then; everybody loved me back then. But I was seated next to the C.E.O. of one of the largest hotel chains in the world at dinner. He was almost a caricature of a business executive, complaining about how he was forced to pay his workers higher wages. He said: “The labor market is super tight. What Trump has done at the border has completely forced me to change the way that I interact with my employees.” And then he pivoted to me: “Well, you understand this as well as anybody. These people just need to get off their asses, come to work and do their job. And now, because we can’t hire immigrants, or as many immigrants, we’ve got to hire these people at higher wages.” The fact that this guy saw me as sympathetic to his problem, and not the problem of the workers, made me realize that I’m on a train that has its own momentum and I have to get off this train, or I’m going to wake up in 10 years and really hate everything that I’ve become. And so I decided to get off that train, and I felt like the only way that I could do that was, in some ways, alienating and offending people who liked my book. Did your perspective on, let’s say, elite liberals change more in that time, or did your perspective on anti-Trump, business-class Republicans change more? Oh, both. I think it’s very hard to say which group of people I felt more strongly about. I literally grew up in a family where my grandmother was negotiating with the Meals on Wheels person to give her more food so that both of us could have something to eat. And I was going to the Sun Valley billionaires boot camp. My life had completely transformed. The people on the left, I would say, whose politics I’m open to — it’s the Bernie Bros. But generally, center-left liberals who are doing very well, and center-right conservatives who are doing very well, have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving. So you reach a point where you feel like you don’t want to be on the same side as, let’s say, the non-Sanders voting fans of your book. How do you go from there to being actively pro-Trump? I was confronted with the reality that part of the reason the anti-Trump conservatives hated Donald Trump was that he represented a threat to a way of doing things in this country that has been very good for them. Go back to the election in 2016. If you’re so inclined, you can say, “Well, Trump’s notreallymaking a criticism of the foreign policy consensus in Washington, D.C. Here’s this thing that he said in 2003 that suggested that he supports invading Iraq — he’s just using this now that it’s politically useful.” I made that argument myself. But the more complete truth is that the country never really litigated the mistakesof the bipartisan consensus until Donald Trump came along, and on the right, nobody had litigated the failures of George W. Bush until Donald Trump came along. Like a lot of other elite conservatives and elite liberals, I allowed myself to focus so much on the stylistic element of Trump that I completely ignored the way in which he substantively was offering something very different on foreign policy, on trade, on immigration. You voted for Trump in 2020? I did. For a lot of Republicans I know, the process of becoming a Trump supporter was different. It was not about deciding that they could live with Trump’s persona because they agreed with his populist critique. It was more that they decided that Trump’s liberal opponents were so terrible in various ways that they needed to support Trump. So you had people who talk about the Kavanaugh hearings as a radicalizing point, or the rise of wokeness. I’m curious what you think about that. This is why I say it’s hard to reconstruct this stuff, it’s so gradual. My wife worked for Kavanaugh, loved the guy — kind of a dork. Never believed these stories. You start looking around and say, “If they can do this to him, can they just do this to any of us?” An incredible campaign of character assassination. I think that [pause; sigh] — I’m trying to make this somewhat appealing to Times readers because probably a lot of them assume Kavanaugh is guilty. If you hadn’t known him, you think you would’ve been more open to that idea? I don’t know. Maybe. The thing that I kept thinking about liberalism in 2019 and 2020 is that these guys have all readCarl Schmitt— there’s no law, there’s just power. And the goal here is to get back in power. Seemed true in the Kavanaugh thing, seemed true in the Black Lives Matter moment, where. … I’m thinking about how to put this. I think most of us who are generally socially aware have a voice in our head that says: “You shouldn’t say this; you should try to say that. Maybe you believe this, but you should try to put it a little bit more diplomatically.” And in 2020 that voice had become absolutely tyrannical. There was nothing you were allowed to say. Offending someone was an act of violence. I think a lot of us just said: “We’re done with this. We’re not playing this game, and we refuse to be policed in what we think and what we say.” Then you recognized that a lot of the pushback to Trump was that kind of social pressure. “You like Donald Trump? But he said these things, and he said that thing.” I saw this in my book tour in 2016. If you even acknowledged that there were reasonablethings that Donald Trump was saying, there was this complete overreaction. And I think that some of us, me included, started to ask ourselves — there’s a voice in your head that tells you what you’re allowed to say and who you’re allowed to vote for. It was clearly deranged in 2020. Well, maybe it was deranged in 2016, too? Is there anything you’ve said that you regret, in the course of refusing to be policed? There are a ton of things I can point to where I can say, “I wish I struck this balance a little bit differently,” but I think that the real danger in American society is not unfiltering yourself, it’s filtering yourself. Let me put the question differently. One interpretation of why conservatives trust Trump is that by saying things that are offensive to the conventions of elite liberalism, he’s effectively burning his ships. He can never just go back to being host of “The Apprentice.” And one interpretation of your Senate campaign was that you were consciously doing the same thing, that you were trying to piss liberals off to make yourself seem more trustworthy to Republican voters. Did you think about it that way? I didn’t think about it quite that way, but before I ran, I had this conversation with myself and my wife that if my underlying critique is correct, there’s no way to run the campaign without burning bridges. You have to self-consciously accept that previous friends of yours are going to think you’re a bad person. Famously, my first TV ad —— Why don’t you describe that ad? Most TV ads are written by consultants; this was written by me. I picked up on the campaign trail that there was a strong undercurrent of people who cared about immigration, who didn’t like being called racist for it, and so I decided to doa direct-to-camera ad: “Are you racist? Do you hate Mexicans?” And then I go into: “No, we’re not. This is why we care about the border; this is why I care about the border.” And that ad was very effective. Again, am I trying to trigger the libs by doing that? No. But am I consciously not allowing myself to be filtered by them? Absolutely. When did you decide that you actually like Donald Trump? I first met Trump in 2021. One of the stories he told me was about how some of our generals were changing the timings of troop redeployments in the Middle East so that they could tell him that the troop levels were coming down when in reality they were just changing the way in which troop levels jump up and down in the short term. [Interviewer’s note: In a follow-up, Vance citedremarksby Trump’s departing Syria envoy, James Jeffrey, in 2020, that “we were always playing shell games to not make clear to our leadership how many troops we had there,” as partial confirmation of the story that the former president had relayed.] The media has this view of Trump as motivated entirely by personal grievance, and the thing he talked the most about — this was not long after Jan. 6 — was “I’m the president, and I told the generals to do something, and they didn’t do it.” And I was like, OK, this guy’s deeper than I’d given him credit for. And alsoIwas deeply offended by this. Talk about a threat to democracy — the generals not listening to the president of the United States about matters like troop redeployment. But just personally, I like him. At one point during my election, some negative story had come out, and I get a phone call out of the blue. “Hey, just wanted to let you know you’re doing a good job. You always hear from the most hateful voices, but there’s a lot of love out there. Don’t forget there’s a lot of love out there. Just stay with it.” He’s much more complex than the media gives him credit for. People think that this guy is motivated entirely by personal grievance and by power, and that he just wants to become president so that he can destroy American democracy. That’s not at all who he is. I want to come back to the democracy question, but first let’s talk about policy. Do you think, generally, that there is a comprehensive populist economic agenda? Well, I have one. The main thrust of the postwar American order of globalization has involved relying more and more on cheaper labor. The trade issue and the immigration issue are two sides of the same coin: The trade issue is cheaper labor overseas; the immigration issue is cheaper labor at home, which applies upward pressure on a whole host of services, from hospital services to housing and so forth. The populist vision, at least as it exists in my head, is an inversion of that: applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible. We’ve had far too little innovation over the last 40 years, and far too much labor substitution. This is why I think the economics profession is fundamentally wrong about both immigration and about tariffs. Yes, tariffs can apply upward pricing pressure on various things — though I think it’s massively overstated — but when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects. It’s a classic formulation: You raise the minimum wage to $20 an hour, and you will sometimes hear libertarians say this is a bad thing. “Well, isn’t McDonald’s just going to replace some of the workers with kiosks?” That’s a good thing, because then the workers who are still there are going to make higher wages; the kiosks will perform a useful function; and that’s the kind of rising tide that actually lifts all boats. What is not good is you replace the McDonald’s worker from Middletown, Ohio, who makes $17 an hour with an immigrant who makes $15 an hour. And that is, I think, the main thrust of elite liberalism, whether people acknowledge it or not. Or the hotels example. If you cannot hire illegal migrants to staff your hotels, then you have to go to one of the seven million prime-age American men who are out of the labor force and find some way to re-engage them. It’s amazing: To this day, I hear from Republican donors, “Oh, I’ll support you because you’re Republican, but you’re not pro-business.” Well, what do you mean I’m not pro-business? I actually really agree with the classic libertarian critique of the regulatory regime. “But we can’t run our business unless we have some of these immigrants coming over, because we can’t find people who are going to do the job.” My response is that there are people who would do those jobs if the incentives were there. The first Trump term did raise wages at the bottom. But Trump ran the economy hot — low interest rates, low taxes — and we’re in a different landscape now, where policymakers seem like they’re stuck choosing between high interest rates, spending cuts and tax increases. I’m curious how you think a populist agenda looks different now. You can’t just run the economy at massive structural deficits indefinitely. But I also think there’s a lot you can do on the regulatory side — make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier — that doesn’t cost money and in fact brings in money. But a nonpopulist Republican would talk a lot more about fiscal discipline. And regardless of your long-term structural plan for the economy, Social Security is going to need some kind of adjustment. The populist move has been to rule out the idea of cutting entitlement spending. But can populists ever raise taxes? Well, as the libertarians always say, a tariff is a tax. [laughs] That’s an answer. I just think the financial problems here are downstream of much deeper problems. One way of understanding the Social Security problem is, old people can’t work, young people can, babies can’t. So people at a certain age support the babies and the old people. And typically in our society, that’s people between the ages of 18 and 65. If the argument here is we have to cut Social Security, then what you’re effectively saying is we just have to privatize what is currently a public problem of who pays for the older generation. And I don’t know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, “You’re on your own.” OK, but in lieu of privatizing the problem, Social Security’s going to need more money. Is the Vance position that the money comes from tariffs? OK, take those seven million prime-age men not in the labor force. Those people are supported, very often, by public resources. You shift millions of those men from not working to working; you increase wages across the board; you increase tariffs; and I think that you buy yourself a whole hell of a lot more than the nine or 10 years that the actuaries say that we have. You get more revenue, yes, from tariffs, but from more people being in the labor force, from higher productivity growth, from higher wages, from transitioning young people who are not working into the work force. Could you get some money by raising taxes on the rich guy who complained to you about his workers? Sure. I’m not philosophically against raising taxes on anybody. But you have to ask yourself, what are the taxes that we’re raising, and where are they coming from? Let’s just say you raise the marginal rate to 42 percent. How much revenue does that actually raise? Raising middle-class taxes — I don’t like that idea for obvious reasons. You can get some revenue out of raising taxes on wealthy Americans, but there’s no way that you can run an economy at a structural growth rate of around 1 percent with demographics that are getting worse and worse and worse and solve the problem by taxing rich people. You have to fix the underlying issue. How would you describe your foreign policy perspective? Not as “Putin first,” as maybe your readers would say —— I asked howyouwould describe it. I’m very self-aware, Ross. Many flaws, that’s not one of them. The term “realist” gets thrown around a lot, and I’d say there are three pillars to realism in the 21st century: The first is that moralisms about “This country is good,” “This country is bad” are largely useless, and we should be dealing with other countries based on whether they’re good or bad for America’s interests. That doesn’t mean you have a complete moral blind spot, but it means that you have to be honest about the countries that you’re dealing with, and there’s a complete failure to do that with most of our foreign policy establishment in this country. No. 2 is the most important lesson of World War II, that we seem to have forgotten: that military power is downstream of industrial power. We are still, right now, the world’s military superpower, largely because of our industrial might from the ’80s and ’90s. But China is a more powerful country industrially than we are, which means they will have a more powerful military in 20 years. And No. 3 is acknowledging that we’re in a multipolar world, and we need allies to step up in big ways so that we can focus on East Asia, which is where our most significant competitor is for the next 20 or 30 years. Should we defend Taiwan if it’s attacked? Our policy effectively is one of strategic ambiguity. I think that we should make it as hard as possible for China to take Taiwan in the first place, and the honest answer is we’ll figure out what we do if they attack. The thing that we can control now is making it costly for them to invade Taiwan, and we’re not doing that because we’re sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine and not Taiwan. Ukraine. Yeah. In theopinion pieceyou wrote for us, you were very critical of the aid that we were giving to Ukraine. But at the end of the piece, you seemed open to the idea of supporting Ukraine in a defensive posture. From a certain perspective, that is what the Biden administration has done. Yes, they supported two Ukrainian counteroffensives, one of which went well and one of which did not. But relative to more hawkish voices, including in your own party, they have tried to avoid direct confrontation with Russia. So I’m curious what you think has been so wrong with their strategy. I know you think we shouldn’t have encouraged the recent counteroffensive —— That’s the most important divergence between me and the Biden administration. I thought the counteroffensive would be a disaster, that we were motivated by moralism and not enough by strategic thinking. The Russians had really adjusted in a lot of profound ways. It was extremely obvious, when you talked to our military leadership in classified settings, they were exceedingly skeptical that the Ukrainians would achieve any strategic breakthrough. OK, why are we doing this then? Is there a more minimalist J.D. Vance plan that would involve limited defensive support for Ukraine as part of a path to armistice? What I would like to do, and what I think fundamentally is achievable here with American leadership — but you never know till you have the conversation — is you freeze the territorial lines somewhere close to where they are right now. That’s No. 1. No. 2 is you guarantee both Kyiv’s independence but also its neutrality. It’s the fundamental thing the Russians have asked from the beginning. I’m not naïve here. I think the Russians have asked for a lot of things dishonestly, but neutrality is clearly something that they see as existential for them. And then three, there’s going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term. I think those three things are certainly achievable, yes. The critique of you and everyone else who opposed the recent appropriation was that if you can’t demonstrate a durable commitment to Ukraine, then Russia doesn’t have any incentive to make peace. If the Russians think they’re winning, how do you give Putin an incentive to make a deal if you’re cutting funding? The leverage that we have over the Russians is not, in my view, that we can indefinitely keep the Ukrainians in a successful defensive posture. Let me be clear about this: There is no way with our capacity and what Russia has been doing that we can hold off the Russians indefinitely. There are two big points of leverage that we have. One, they could take over Ukraine, but they can’t govern Ukraine. We’re talking about multiple hundreds of thousands of troops to govern the country effectively as a Russian subsidiary. The second point of leverage that we have is a war economy has its own internal momentum. They’re now at 7 percent of G.D.P. being spent on defense. They have re-engineered an economy around fighting a war instead of around improving the lives of your people. That has some real problems over the long term. By the way, it’s not in our interest, either, for the Russians to have a war economy for the next five years, because then they’re going to be more militaristic and aggressive than they otherwise would be. You agree it’s not in our interest right now for the Russians to roll through the rest of Ukraine? No, it is not in our interest. Let’s go back to Trump. You used the term “stylistic” to describe the things you didn’t like about Trump in 2016. Obviously, people who oppose Trump think that style and substance are intertwined, and that Trumpism is a substantive threat to democratic norms. That argument got a really big boost on the 6th of January, 2021. So, first, what’s your take on the legitimacy of the 2020 election? First of all, grant that there is overlap between style and substance. I think this is actually, in theforeign policy arena especially, a strength of Trump, and not a weakness. Trump is, as his detractors and his supporters would say, unpredictable. He is extremely self-aware of that perception, and without revealing state secrets, I am 100 percent certain that unpredictability redounded to the benefit of the United States. I have two basic critiques of the 2020 election, and then I have a critique of the reaction to what Trump did. My actual critique starts with the Molly Ball article in 2021 — that felt like bragging. I put that article in front of the average Trump-fan Republican voter in my hometown, and they say, “That is an illegitimate election.” [Interviewer’s note: Vanceis referencingBall’s post-election Timemagazinefeature detailing the attempts to “fortify” the 2020 election against Trumpian malfeasance and pandemic disruptions, efforts that Ball described as “a well-funded cabal of powerful people, ranging across industries and ideologies, working together behind the scenes to influence perceptions, change rules and laws, steer media coverage and control the flow of information.”] The argument is basically that there were a host of institutional actors, technology companies, various forms of censorship, that mobilized in 2020 in a way that they hadn’t in 2016. There was tech censorship. People were primed to push back against any October surprises. And look, October surprises are part of American democracy, and whether you think Hunter Biden is as major an issue as I do or disagree, in American democracy you let the voters decide. That was a way in which the basic democratic will of America was obstructed. I don’t see any reason to think that Dominion voting machines switched ballots, but there was a breakdown in democratic will. Point No. 2 is that the rules of the game were changed in the middle. When does a ballot have to be mailed in Pennsylvania to count under the election rules? That was changed. That was changed for Covid reasons, in a way that partially is the fault of the Republican National Committee — we weren’t prepared for it, Democrats were, and they took advantage of it. And this gets to my third point, the critique of people like me as violating some sacred norm of American democracy. I never could get fired up about this. I think the election in 1960 was stolen. The election of 2000 had some issues. I think that challenging elections and questioning the legitimacy of elections is actually part of the democratic process. When Trump says the election was stolen, and people say he was wrong, I say, “Fine, we can argue about that.” When they say, “He’s threatening the foundation of American society,” I can’t help but roll my eyes. OK, but Donald Trump was president of the United States while those changes to voting rules were being made. And Rudy Giuliani was not standing up complaining about, say,Mark Zuckerberg’s fundingfor get-out-the-vote efforts. They went for the straight-up voter fraud narratives, which yielded the idea that Mike Pence was going to somehow send this back to the states to be relitigated, which yielded Jan. 6. What was the point of all that? Fine, you can challenge the sacred norms of democracy, but the way they were challenged was, by your own argument, paranoid and probably wrong. Well, if you want me to defend Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis in the aftermath of the 2020 election, they made a lot of arguments I disagreed with. If the criticism is, when Tucker Carlson called me in July and said, “Dude, I think they’re going to steal the election over a lot of these changed balloting rules,” the R.N.C. should’ve been mobilizing and responding to that, and they failed, and that was a huge indictment of the R.N.C. — then yeah, absolutely, I agree with that. But once that failed, did it make any sense to use the office of the vice presidency to shift the outcome of the election? The vice-presidential thing — look, here’s what this would’ve looked like if you really wanted to do this. You would’ve actually tried to go to the states that had problems; you would try to marshal alternative slates of electors, like they did in the election of 1876. And then you have to actually prosecute that case; you have to make an argument to the American people. Let’s say you were a Republican legislator in Pennsylvania. Do you think it would have been a good idea to say, “Under the rules of the election, Joe Biden won the most votes, but we’re going to vote to send a slate of Trump electors because Twitter censored the Hunter Biden story.” Do I think that it would have been an ultimately effective argument? No, do you think it would have been a good argument? I think the entire post-2020 thing would have gone a lot better if there had actually been an effort to provide alternative slates of electors and to force us to have that debate. I think it would’ve been a much better thing for the country. Do I think Joe Biden would still be president right now? Yeah, probably. But at least we would have had a debate. And instead what we had was the Jenna Ellis legal clown show and no real debate about the election. And now every time we bring it up, it’s like, “Well, yeah, they litigated all these things.” No, you can’t litigate these things judicially; you have to litigate them politically. And we never had a real political debate about the 2020 election. You mentioned the 1876 election. The 1876 election was effectively a constitutional crisis, right? Sure. It was absolutely a constitutional crisis. For those of us who don’t think that Donald Trump is about to become a dictator, it still seems like he has an appetite for constitutional crisis. Pursuing the Pence strategy might not have ended with Trump back in the White House. But it would have pushed America into a crisis whose only point would be to satisfy either the voters whose concerns you describe, or Trump himself. Even under a circumstance where the alternative-electors thing works, and he’s president again, he would have served four years and retired and enjoyed his life and played golf. The idea that this sets off a sequence where Donald Trump becomes the dictator of America is completely preposterous. He was using the constitutional procedures. Now, your argument is that he was using them ineffectively, or maybe even illegitimately, but he was trying to take a constitutional process to its natural conclusion. My argument is that he was using them recklessly, without concern for the effect on the body politic of him becoming president because he got state legislatures to vote in alternate slates of electors. My counterargument to that is that what was reckless was the effort to try to take this very legitimate grievance over our most fundamental democratic act as a people, and completely suppress concerns about it. This is maybe where you think I’ve just jumped the shark, but if there’s a constitutional crisis I’m worried about, it’s not Donald Trump using a process that exists in our Constitution. It’s that he was the commander in chief and ordered the military to do something and the military didn’t. Why can’t it be both? Why can’t you say, “It was wrong the way the military and the administrative state behaved under Trump, and it also would’ve been a really, really bad idea for Mike Pence to intervene on Jan. 6”? If the conservative response to this is to say “both sides are bad,” and the liberal response to this is to say “it’s fine when my side does it, and it’s bad when the other side does it,” the liberals will always win the argument in this country. I really don’t believe this is about some deep principle; this is about power. Don’t you think that doing the right thing sometimes enhances your power? If Trump had walked away, if he hadn’t spent so much time pressuring Pence, don’t you think he might be ahead in the polls by more right now? I want to be clear: I’m not conceding the premise that Trump was engaged in something fundamentally bad here. But maybe you’re right that if Trump had just gotten into the helicopter and ridden off, that he would be in a better position today. Maybe. But an entire section of our democratic republic would’ve had their concerns ignored. There are meaningful improvements that have been made on election integrity, like the Georgia voter ID law, which would never have happened without this massive public debate. And I think it would’ve been extraordinarily disappointing to a whole host of people that I care a lot about if Trump had just taken it. In his very unique way, he gave voice to a series of concerns. But there was also a riot in the midst of the peaceful transfer of power. The argument that you’re making, I could’ve imagined myself making up till —— On Jan. 5. Exactly. But it just seems like this is a case where, with Trump, you turn the dial and — even if you think dial-turning is a good way to intimidate Putin or Kim Jong-un — sometimes you turn it too far. I think people really, really underrate the sense to which there is palpable and actionable frustration, and I’m always surprised that their assumption appears to be that Trump is the worst, rather than the best, expression of that frustration. Or at least, one of the better in the whole host of possibilities. We’re in this moment where people are really pissed off, and I think for legitimate reasons. And I don’t understand, looking at the country that we have right now, and saying, “The riot on January the 6th was the worst expression of this.” If Donald Trump asked you to be his running mate, would you accept? I’ll give you the stock answer: I’ve never talked about it with him, which is genuine. I don’t get the sense that he’s focused on it. If he asked me, certainly I would be interested, but I’m trying not to think too much about it until he actually asks. The Times is committed to publishinga diversity of lettersto the editor.

It didn't -- it didn't amount to what we've seen on the ground, and what we've documented. And like I said, it just raises more questions than it actually answer.ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Right.Jeremy Diamond, thank you very much.That's it for us. The news continues. \"THE SOURCE WITH KAITLAN COLLINS\" starts now. I'll see you, tomorrow.KAITLAN COLLINS, CNN HOST: Straight from THE SOURCE tonight.From never-Trumper to potential vice president. Never say never, I guess. Republican senator, J.D. Vance, now one of Donald Trump's staunchest advocates, not only trying to help him win the White House, but also in the running to join him this time. He joins us live, in moments.And the former President back on the campaign trail, tonight, after being held in contempt, for violating his gag order, nine times. He's now racing back to New York, just to learn if he just violated it again.Also tonight, we are tracking the clashes and the crackdowns that are happening on college campuses across America. Hundreds of protesters have been arrested. And we'll show you new exclusive police bodycam footage, in moments.One of our sources tonight is former New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, on how his successor is handling it all.I'm Kaitlan Collins. And this is THE SOURCE.At long last, there is music to Donald Trump's ears. Macho Man and Y.M.C.A., the hallmarks of his MAGA rallies, blaring again today, as the former President returned to the campaign trail for the first time since his criminal trial began here in New York.Trump held rallies in two critical battleground states that he captured in 2016, but lost in 2020, Michigan and Wisconsin. Yet even out on the campaign trail, the legal cloud was still hovering over him.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT: As you know, I have come here today from New York City, where I'm being forced to sit for days on end, in a kangaroo courtroom, with a corrupt and conflicted judge, enduring a Biden Sideshow trial.(AUDIENCE BOOS)TRUMP: I have a judge who gags me. I'm not allowed to talk about things.(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: It's really just a normal courtroom. I've been inside of there, as Trump was sitting at the defense table.And I should note this is not a Biden trial. His claims about the judge being corrupt are baseless.But despite his assertion that he's not allowed to talk about this case, while he is talking about this case, on camera, he is allowed to say everything that you just heard there. Attacks on the judge don't fall under the gag order that Trump is under.And his return to the campaign trail was quite brief. He'll actually be back here in court tomorrow when his hush money trial resumes, and bright and early at that.Before the witness gets back on the stand tomorrow, there will be another hearing on whether Trump violated his gag order again. He was just found to be in contempt of court, and fined $9,000 for violating the order nine different times. The judge, in his finding, warned that Trump could go to jail, if he continues to attack witnesses and jurors.Trump didn't comment on either today though. He did attack President Biden, and take credit for restricting abortion rights. And also, he weighed in on the nationwide protests that we are seeing, on college campuses.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: The radical extremists and far-left agitators are terrorizing college campuses.When you see that video of raging lunatics, and Hamas sympathizers at Columbia and other colleges.(AUDIENCE BOOS)TRUMP: No, but when you look at it, I say where did these people come from?Where did they come from? And they do come from other countries, and they are paid.(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: I should note that we have not seen any evidence that protesters are being paid to be on these campuses.But while Trump was in Wisconsin today, he also addressed the question, the open one, of who he's considering to be his running mate, come November.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)JASON CALVI, POLITICAL REPORTER, FOX6 NEWS: Who's on your shortlist?

I think he's been great.CALVI: Is he one of your tops?TRUMP: Well, he's one of the people I respect.(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: My source tonight is also a top contender to be Donald Trump's vice presidential pick, Republican senator of Ohio, J.D. Vance.And Senator Vance, thank you for being here.On just what we're seeing on college campuses, you've been very outspoken, about the need for free speech on college campuses. But I wonder where you believe the line is in defending free speech and denouncing hate speech.SEN. J.D. VANCE (R-OH): Yes, Kaitlan, the way that I think about it is that you have a right to free speech. People are allowed to speak. But you don't have a right to turn college campuses into garbage dumps. You don't have a right to prevent other students from going to class. And you don't have the right to commit violence.[21:05:00]And so, I think it's pretty straightforward. We're never going to strike that balance perfectly. But there's clearly, I think, an effort, in this country, to make sure that we have a First Amendment right to speech. And at the same time, we make sure that students can go to school without attacks.And sorry, there's sort of weird echo.COLLINS: OK. Maybe it's mix-minus. We'll see if the Control Room can stop that, because I know how crazy it is when you can hear yourself.But on that, in your home state of Ohio, I know Republicans led in passing a law, protecting free speech on campuses. We saw that students at your alma mater were arrested, even though the newspaper had described it as pretty much a quite peaceful protest.And I just wonder how you see how administrators are handling what's happening there. What's happening, like what we saw at Columbia, last night, here in New York?VANCE: Yes, Kaitlan, nobody's going to strike this balance perfectly.And I appreciate you fixing the audio issue. It is fixed.COLLINS: OK.VANCE: But the basic problem here is that you do have some radicals, in these protests, who are committing violence, who are preventing students from going to class.And certainly, you don't want to arrest people, who are just engaging in basic First Amendment speech. But you also want to make sure that people can go to school safely, and that college campuses, which of course, are public spaces, are not turned into garbage dumps by these encampments.So look, I'm sure that we can find examples of college administrators being too aggressive, and how these -- they police these things. But I also think you can find some pretty good examples of students, who are clearly violating the rights of other students, and violating the law, by engaging in some of these protests.So, we've got to strike that balance. I think that so far, we're doing a pretty good job in this country, between letting people express their viewpoint, but not making sure, or at least, I should say, making sure that our Jewish students and other students are able to go to class without infringement.COLLINS: Yes.VANCE: The other thing I'll say, Kaitlan, I come at this from a very pro-Israel perspective. And my view on this is that Israel is our ally, and that we should support them. But you can't police people for being anti-Israel or pro-Israel. You can't police people for violating the law. And we have seen some of that with some of these protests.COLLINS: OK. So, you agree that people, who break in, and vandalize a building should be prosecuted?VANCE: Exactly. COLLINS: OK. I'm just checking because you did help raise money for people who did so on January 6th, which was impeding an official proceeding, breaking into a building that they weren't allowed to be in, and vandalizing the Capitol.VANCE: Well, Kaitlan, I know that this is the obsession of the national media to talk about what happened two years ago, three years ago, on January the 6th, as opposed to talk about the future.COLLINS: It's not an obsession. I'm just seeing if it's a double standard.VANCE: No. Let me -- no, let me -- let me answer the question, Kaitlan. I mean, look, here's my -- been my basic argue about January the 6th. If you beat up a cop, of course, you deserve to go to prison. If you violated the law, you should suffer the consequences.But there are people, who protested on January the 6th, who have had the complete weight of the Justice Department thrown at them, when at worst, they're accused of misdemeanors. Now, again, there are people who are accused of worst offenses, and that's a problem.But you can't have Black Lives Matter protesters, who rioted and vandalized goes free, when you have people, who were actually peacefully protesting, on January the 6th, who have the book thrown at them. That's the double standard that I'm most worried about.COLLINS: Yes, I don't think there's an obsession with January 6th. But it is a legitimate question.And given what you just said there, and as Trump is getting closer to, as he's the presumptive Republican nominee, he has said he would pardon, it's considered a blanket pardon, for everyone, on January 6th.Are you saying that that shouldn't happen? People who beat up cops should be excluded from that?VANCE: Well, I think what President Trump has said -- and of course, he can speak for himself. But I pay attention, pretty close attention to what he says. And yes, I think what the President has said is that people, who have this double standard applied to them should be pardoned.And you shouldn't have the Department of Justice letting violent offenders walk scot-free, and then you have a misdemeanor trespassing case from January the 6th, that person has their life ruined, because of the lawfare of the Biden administration.I think that's a totally reasonable standard for the President to apply. Hopefully, he does get reelected. And I think, frankly, there are some innocent people, who have been caught up in the lawfare of the Biden administration, Donald Trump included, if we're being honest.COLLINS: But the ones who beat up cops, should they be excluded? VANCE: Certainly, if you assaulted a police officer, you should go to prison.COLLINS: OK.VANCE: And I think that's a pretty broad and agreed standard, across the political spectrum. At least I hope so. I certainly think that my fellow conservatives agree.COLLINS: OK. We'll see if Trump agrees with that.But back to what's happening on these campuses, as this has been such a national story. Trump, when he was in New York, compared it to what happened in Charlottesville, in 2017. Obviously, when neo-Nazis were chanting, Jews will not replace us, three people were killed, 35 were injured. Trump said that was a little peanut compared to what we're seeing right now.Is that an accurate equivalency in your view?VANCE: Well, look, I think that what you've seen is nationwide, anti- Semitic protests, and number of students who have been assaulted, and number of people who have prevented from exercising their constitutional rights.And I think Trump, as he often does, highlights the really ridiculous double standards that sometimes exist in this country.When you had what was coded as a conservative protest that had a lot of anti-Semites, the entire national media was preoccupied with it, obsessed with it, I would say.[21:10:00]When you have a series of very often--COLLINS: Yes.VANCE: --anti-Semitic protests, all across college campuses, a number of acts of vandalism, somehow all of a sudden, the media doesn't care about it.I think it's reasonable for the President to draw attention to that. And I agree with him.COLLINS: But what was happening in Charlottesville was one of the largest gatherings of White nationalists in a decade.Obviously, what's happening on these campuses, we've seen how it's gotten out of control. But ostensibly, they're there protesting the war in Gaza.I just I'm curious why there's a need to compare the two, and if you see it that way.VANCE: Well, I don't necessarily think there's a need to compare. In fact, I'd say that President Trump is one of the few people, who'sactually condemned both sides. In other words, he condemned the protest in Charlottesville, to the extent that it got violent. He also noted, honestly, that there were peaceful protesters in Charlottesville, too. He's also condemned the protests that have broken out, across our college campuses.So again, I think that if you actually look at what President Trump has said, he's making a reasonable observation that there's a ridiculous media double standard. But he has, I think, the courage to condemn acts of anti-Semitism, whether they're coming from the perceived right or the perceived left.COLLINS: I would disagree that it's a media double standard.But you're a Yale-educated attorney. And I want to get your take on what we saw happen, last week, those immunity arguments, before the Supreme Court, where Trump's team, his attorney argued that a president could order the military to stage a coup, and to have their political opponent assassinated, and be immune from prosecution, unless this theory that they were impeached and then convicted by the Senate.Do you share the view that presidents are basically above the law?VANCE: Look, look, Kaitlan, I think we have to be careful about imputing words into the President's attorneys that they didn't actually say.What the President's attorneys said is that--COLLINS: He agreed with it.VANCE: What the President's attorneys said, Kaitlan, to be clear, is that there is a checks and balances system, in our Constitution.Now, some things the president does, private acts, are liable to criminal penalties. But most of the things that the president does in their official duties, we have a system of impeachment, we have a system of checks and balances, in the legislative branch that I'm a member of, the judicial branch.I did not read the President's attorneys saying that the President could order a coup. The President's attorneys were saying that the constitutional checks and balances system--COLLINS: No. No.VANCE: --would address that problem.COLLINS: OK. But let me stop you right there.VANCE: And I think that's an important distinction.COLLINS: But let me stop you right there. Because I listened to this. It's John Sauer, Trump's attorney. And when he was asked by one of the justices, if the President could order the military to stage a coup, and would it count as an official act, meaning he couldn't be prosecuted for it? He said it would depend on the circumstances.I mean, what circumstances warrant a president ordering the military to stage a coup?VANCE: Well, first of all, I did say it depends on the circumstances. That opens up a whole lot of avenue for context there.But more importantly, Kaitlan, he's just saying that would count as an official act.COLLINS: But that's not--VANCE: But there are a number -- there are--COLLINS: That's an official act, in your view too?VANCE: But can I finish the answer to the question, Kaitlan?An official act, there are a number of checks and balances in our system. There's the impeachment process. There's the budgeting authority that Congress has. There are a number of ways, where Congress has a check and balance control over the President of the United States.All he's saying is that the criminal liability procedures that exist in this country don't cover the President's official acts. And by the way, how could anybody disagree with that, Kaitlan? Should Barack Obama be prosecuted for killing an American citizen via a drone strike?There are a number of examples, in American history, where if you apply the standard, the lawfare standard of the Biden administration, against Donald Trump, it would make the presidency impossible, to actually execute the law. So, in the name of taking down--COLLINS: Yes. I know that's the argument that--VANCE: In the name of taking down their political opponent, Kaitlan, these guys are, are really pushing a legal theory that I think would destroy the presidency, whether a Democrat or Republican was in charge.COLLINS: Well, I don't think Jack Smith is running for office.But on what you're saying, you're basically saying that if the president orders the military, to stage a coup, you believe the only remediation for that is that he can be impeached, or that Congress can restrict the budget?VANCE: Well, Kaitlan, first of all, you're dealing with hypotheticals here that are completely outside the bounds of this particular situation. Donald Trump did not order a coup, despite the fact that a lot of media people say that he did, on January the 6th. He encouraged people to protest peacefully. And of course, most people on January 6th did protest peacefully.What I'm saying is that you have to have some measure of liability, for the official acts of Presidency of the United States. And the way to create a check and balance on that system is what the Constitution prescribes here.You can't have prosecutors, many of whom, of course, are deeply embedded with the Democratic Party, trying to destroy the life of a former President, who's now running for president, because they think that they have a better argument, for what that president should have done.You can have a political disagreement with Donald Trump, and that's totally reasonable. You shouldn't destroy the presidency in the process.COLLINS: OK.[21:15:00]VANCE: And I think that's what a lot of the Biden administration Department of Justice is trying to do.COLLINS: But you essentially are agreeing that the presidents should not be able to be prosecuted.Let me ask you something else. Because, as I mentioned, there is an open question of who Donald Trump will pick to be his vice presidential candidate.We just heard him talking about Marco Rubio.You're hosting a fundraiser with him, in your home state of Ohio, later this month.I know you say that you two haven't discussed the vice presidency directly. But you said you'd certainly be open to it if he did offer it to you. Considering that, does it give you any pause whatsoever about taking that job when you see how he treated his last vice president?VANCE: Well, Kaitlan, first of all, again, I haven't talked to Donald Trump about becoming vice president.I think it's important to support President Trump, as Republicans, because I think he was a good president. And I think that he made the country more prosperous. And I think he made the world more peaceful.What gives me pause, Kaitlan, is another four years of Biden's administration, where he's opened the borders, and where you have, effectively a conflict, a major world conflict in nearly every continent in the world, so. COLLINS: But my question was not about President Biden. It's about President Trump.VANCE: Well, look, it's fundamentally about President Biden, because if you're comparing the two records of these presidents, and asking, who do I want to be president, it's very clearly that I want Donald Trump to be president.And I understand that there are a lot of things that people like you disagree that he did. But I think fundamentally, he was a good president. He accomplished a lot for the country. And the question fundamentally for our country is, do we want four more years of Joe Biden? Or do we want four more years, the peace and prosperity of Donald Trump?COLLINS: Well I--VANCE: That to me is an easy question.COLLINS: The last time I checked, President Biden wasn't approval -- approving of the chants to hang his vice president, and did not call his vice president, when their life was in danger, on Capitol Hill, something that Mike Pence himself has testified to.So my question is does it give you any pause to be his vice president, given how he has treated Mike Pence?VANCE: Kaitlan, I'm extremely skeptical that Mike Pence's life was ever in danger. I think politics -- in politics, people like to really exaggerate things, from time to time. I know a lot of folks, in the Democratic Party--COLLINS: I think Mike Pence would disagree with that, Senator.VANCE: A lot of folks, in the Democratic Party, Kaitlan, act as if January the 6th was the scariest moment of their lives.I think, look, January 6th was a bad day. It was a riot. But the idea that Donald Trump endangered anyone's lives, when he told them to protest peacefully, it's just absurd. And the entire legal basis of this prosecution of Donald Trump, from Jack Smith--COLLINS: But they were chanting that they wanted to hang him.VANCE: Look, Kaitlan did a few people say some bad things? Sure. But do we blame Donald Trump for every bad thing that's ever been said, by a participant in American democracy? I think that's an absurd standard.And look, Kaitlan, I know you're worried, and look, I think, justifiably so--COLLINS: This isn't about me, Senator.VANCE: --about threats to American-- COLLINS: I'm asking questions about you, and how you would feel about this.VANCE: Yes, look, I'm trying to answer the question. I'd appreciate if you let me.We know that there are threats to American democracy. I think the biggest threat to American democracy, Kaitlan, is that the Biden administration is trying to prevent Donald Trump from campaigning, and taking his case to the American people.COLLINS: It's a judge, in New York--VANCE: Even as they hide their own candidate.COLLINS: --that's presiding over that case. It's -- the Biden administration is not preventing Donald Trump from campaigning.VANCE: This -- this is a--COLLINS: He just did two campaign events tonight.VANCE: This is a really important point, Kaitlan. Who is the number three person, from the Biden Department of Justice, who went to work for the New York prosecutor, just months before he brought this case, against Donald Trump?You can't have people moving, from the Biden administration, to prosecute Donald Trump, in New York, and say it has nothing to do with the Biden administration, especially--COLLINS: Attorneys go from the Justice Department--VANCE: --when the judge is a Biden administration donor.COLLINS: --to local D.A.'s offices all the time. That's not that unusual.VANCE: It's pretty--COLLINS: I mean, you're an attorney. You know that.VANCE: It's pretty unusual.COLLINS: You probably have colleagues, who went to Yale with you that did that.VANCE: It's pretty unusual for the number three person, in the Department of Justice, to then go to the New York prosecutor's office, to bring a bogus case against Donald Trump, and then to have the judge presiding over that case, to be a donor to Biden-Harris. I think that's pretty unusual, Kaitlan.And really is, aside from your views or anyone else's views about Donald Trump, this is a real threat to Americans' trust in the legal system. If you look at polling, even a lot of folks, who are going to vote for Joe Biden think that the lawfare against Donald Trump is bogus. We're destroying faith, in the American system of law and in order--COLLINS: OK.VANCE: --to try to bring down Joe Biden's political opponent. That's a threat to democracy.COLLINS: It's a jury of his peers that indicted him, and a jury of his peers that will be -- that are in that room, right now, and will decide this case.Senator J.D. Vance, thank you for joining us, here on THE SOURCE.VANCE: Thanks for having me.COLLINS: Up next. Maggie Haberman is here to talk about that interview.Also, the view from Trump-world about his ongoing trial as he's set to return tomorrow.Also, amid the ongoing chaos that is happening on college campuses, we're learning more tonight, about the influence, the potential involvement of outside agitators in this, and questions over what we're hearing from the New York City Mayor on that.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[21:23:51]COLLINS: Moments ago, you just heard from Republican senator, and potential Trump running mate, J.D. Vance, on everything that is going on, and including with that potential question of who Trump is going to pick.I asked him what he thought about this idea. We've heard from J.D. Vance, on what he would have done if he was Vice President on January 6th. He wouldn't have done what Mike Pence did. He's made that clear.But also a question was what he thinks about how Donald Trump has treated his former Vice President.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: The last time I checked, President Biden wasn't approval -- approving of the chants to hang his vice president, and did not call his vice president, when their life was in danger, on Capitol Hill, something that Mike Pence himself has testified to.So my question is does it give you any pause to be his vice president, given how he has treated Mike Pence?VANCE: Kaitlan, I'm extremely skeptical that Mike Pence's life was ever in danger. I think politics -- in politics, people like to really exaggerate things, from time to time. I know a lot of folks, in the Democratic Party--COLLINS: I think Mike Pence would disagree with that, Senator.(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: My source, tonight, to react to that, New York Times Senior Political Correspondent, and CNN Political Analyst, Maggie Haberman, now Trump court-watcher as we were in the courtroom yesterday.[21:25:00]On J.D. Vance, he is someone who is, you know, there are a lot of names always swirling around, for Trump's potential vice president. But J.D. Vance is usually on the top of the list, when you talk to these people, in Trump's orbit.MAGGIE HABERMAN, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: 100 percent, there's a lot of people who think that ultimately it will be Vance.Now, to be clear, we have no idea what Trump is going to do.COLLINS: Yes.HABERMAN: And it's a real fool's errand to try to predict who he's going to choose for anything.But Vance is very clearly a top choice. And part of it is because of what we just saw in that interview. He is really effective in defending Trump on television.Now, I think the Secret Service would also disagree that Mike Pence's life was not in danger. But that's a separate issue. Vance is communicating the message that Trump wants, both on the legal cases and against the media.And so, there are -- there are a lot of reasons, including Trump's own personal comfort and chemistry. You know this as well as anybody. For Trump, so much of what he does with personnel comes down to chemistry and interpersonal relationships. And he really likes Vance.COLLINS: He also brought up Matthew Colangelo there, at the end. That is one of the prosecutors, on the Manhattan District Attorney's team.HABERMAN: Yes.COLLINS: When Trump was going after him, that was found to be a violation of the gag order.HABERMAN: Yes.COLLINS: And the gag order was -- or the gag order was expanded, I should say, to include the people on Alvin Bragg's team, not Alvin Bragg.HABERMAN: Right.COLLINS: Because there was a concern about them being put at risk, for implications like that.Trump's got another gag order hearing, tomorrow.HABERMAN: Yes.COLLINS: I mean, I wonder what you're making of how he's reacting to being fined. $9,000 is not a huge fee for him. But being told by the judge, if you keep doing this jail is a real possibility.HABERMAN: There are some people around him, who think that he is intentionally trying to see how far he can go, and that he thinks that being jailed will help him even if it's for a day.Most people I talked to, who know Trump pretty well, do not think that he actually really wants to go to jail. There's -- I don't think he wants to sit in that courtroom every day. Did people think that jail is going to be a more pleasant experience for him?But I do think that we see him often go up and touch the hot stove, and then he comes back a little bit. And sometimes, he goes up again. He is always testing the bounds of what he can get away with.Now, he did take down the social media posts that he was ordered to take down yesterday.COLLINS: Yes.HABERMAN: He did not, as you note, attack witnesses, or people connected to the case, relatives of the court, et cetera, at his rallies today. But we'll see what happens going forward.COLLINS: Yes, Trump doesn't even like to stay in hotel rooms.HABERMAN: Correct.COLLINS: I remember, on foreign trips, when he was president, he didn't even like staying in other hotel rooms.But on the courtroom itself, you and I were both in there. You were in the row, in front of me yesterday, watching. It's really fascinating to be inside that courtroom, and to see it. There's no cameras. But to actually see it with your own eyes, and to watch Trump's demeanor, as people like Keith Davidson, are testifying about negotiating hush money payments, on Stormy Daniels' behalf with him.HABERMAN: Yesterday was very tense in that courtroom. And there have been some days that have been tense. Some days have been pretty lax.Yesterday was very tense for a couple of reasons. The testimony that you're talking about, you had Keith Davidson, the lawyer for Stormy Daniels, during that time period of October 2016, just reading, to validate these text exchanges with Michael Cohen or with Dylan Howard, the AMI executive, who he was working with.And they were really, really damaging, about Trump, with his middle son, sitting behind him in the courtroom, and a phalanx of aides. The Texas Attorney General, Ken Paxton, was there. David McIntosh, from the Club for Growth was there. This was unusual to watch.And Trump deals with it. Sometimes, he is sleeping. I know there's this huge sleeping debate. But sometimes--COLLINS: Yes. The great debate of our time--HABERMAN: Right.COLLINS: --is his sleeping.HABERMAN: Most important thing of the trial, and I mean that in no way.But sometimes, he is -- sometimes he is sleeping. That is a 100 percent true. I've seen it. People around him have confirmed to me that he has been sleeping at times that we have said he is.However, sometimes he is closing his eyes, and I've talked to people around him about this too, because that is how he tries to just basically stay calm and deal with it. And whether that then leads to sleep or whatever, who knows? But he is sitting there with his eyes closed for long periods of time. It's not always sleeping.COLLINS: Yes, I noticed this, because he's very clearly awake, but his eyes are closed, for like a minute at a time as--HABERMAN: Sometimes more, yes.COLLINS: --as Keith Davidson or the witnesses is answering. It's like he doesn't want to hear what they're saying either.HABERMAN: I think it's -- I think it is a compartmentalization method. And he's pretty good at compartmentalizing,COLLINS: And I know you'll be back in the courtroom, tomorrow.HABERMAN: Yes.COLLINS: Maggie Haberman, great reporting as always. Thank you.HABERMAN: Up next, we have new exclusive video, here tonight on CNN, of the arrest of protesters at Columbia University. This is from the bodycams of the police officers, as they were going into the building to arrest them.New York City's former Mayor Bill de Blasio is here to weigh in, his take on how his predecessor has been handling -- his successor, I should note, has been handling the unrest.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[21:33:52]COLLINS: Tonight, you are seeing, right now, exclusive video to CNN, from NYPD bodycams that show the moments, and take you inside last night, as police retook Columbia University's Hamilton Hall, from the pro-Palestinian protesters inside.(VIDEO - EXCLUSIVE BODYCAM SHOWS NYPD BREACHING COLUMBIA BUILDING)COLLINS: The crackdown that you were seeing here, where hundreds of protesters were arrested, is exactly why New York City Mayor, Eric Adams, has come under scrutiny. He has been defending the City's response, including on CNN, here tonight.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)MAYOR ERIC ADAMS (D-NYC, NY): We need to be clear on this. I received a letter, from the school. And in the letter from the school, that ask us to come in, they said it was a clear and present danger, and that they had outside individuals, who were on the grounds participate in this activity.So, it was not only our observation, from our intelligence division, but it was also the school officials who asked us to step in.(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: Mayor Adams is saying that many of the 280 protesters, arrested last night, were outside agitators, which students at Columbia are pushing back on.[21:35:00](BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When NYPD came in, they pushed all press away from -- from where we were, so they couldn't document anything. And then, they ambushed us, they tackled us, they beat us. And I want to also highlight that majority of the protesters there, last night, were young women, were young college women from marginalized communities.(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: I should note, while CNN has not been given a breakdown of how many outsiders they say were arrested, at Columbia, last night. We are getting numbers from New York University. School officials there say less than half of those arrested at protests, on campus, last week, were students and staff members. We're still trying to figure out the numbers from last night.Joining me now here to discuss is former New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio.And Mayor, obviously, you know exactly the role and the position that Eric Adams is now in. What do you make of how he's been handling this? Is it how you would handle it?BILL DE BLASIO, (D) FORMER MAYOR OF NEW YORK CITY: Yes, I think he did the right thing. Look, you can't have protests turn into violence. You just can't allow it to happen.I respect protesters, peaceful protesters, who are saying they want a change in U.S. policy, for example. That's legitimate freedom of speech.But when you start taking over buildings, destroying property, creating an atmosphere that bluntly, is threatening to a lot of other fellow students, and extremely disruptive, that's the point where something has to be done.COLLINS: Yes. But I think there is that question about his claim about the outside agitators.And the only reason it's been questioned and raised is because before they went in, this is kind of what he had said was the rationale for going in.Some of the people though, that he's saying were there, say they weren't there, in recent days, at least two of the women, one of them says she wasn't there. Another says, she was a 63-year-old that was on campus, and she's someone, who is known to go to a lot of protests, and is an activist.I mean, if you're in leadership, when you say things like that matters.DE BLASIO: Yes, of course. But Kaitlan, there has been a trend, in recent years, to -- a small group of protesters, who are willing to use violence. We saw this in the 2020 protests. We saw it all over the country. I was talking to mayors all over the country in that very, very tense moment. Vast majority of people were peacefully protesting. But there was a subset that were willing to use violence.COLLINS: Yes, we saw the riots. I mean, we just heard Senator J.D. Vance talking about that.DE BLASIO: And unfortunately, you could have five people, 10 people, 20 people who poison the well for everyone else. But the minute you introduce violence, it's incumbent upon leaders, to step in and bring back peace and order to the situation.And by the way, I would say, the protesters -- I've been a protester myself over the years. If you let folks, who are going to commit violence, into your ranks, you actually undermine your own cause.So, I respect the students, who are lifting their voices, and acting non-violently. But they actually have responsibility too, to make sure that everyone in their movement comports themselves peacefully.COLLINS: It's been fascinating to watch how your party has been handling this. Different Democrats, obviously not a monolith, handling this differently.Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was asked about these protests, in recent days, when she was on Capitol Hill. And I just want you to hear what she said about Jewish students, on college campuses, in a comment from this weekend.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) REP. ILHAN OMAR (D-MN): I think it is really unfortunate that people don't care about the fact that all Jewish kids should be kept safe, and that we should not have to tolerate anti-Semitism or bigotry, for all Jewish students, whether they are pro-genocide or anti-genocide.(END VIDEO CLIP)DE BLASIO: Look.COLLINS: Pro-genocide or anti-genocide?DE BLASIO: I mean, that's a horrible terminology. And I've disagreed with the Congressmember before. I disagree with her using those words.But I will say there are a lot of students who feel afraid. I know plenty of Jewish students, around this country, feel afraid right now. And they've been exposed to clearly anti-Semitic language. That's not everyone who's protesting.Again, I believe most people are protesting, are trying to raise legitimate concerns, about what's happening in the region, and calling for peace. I want peace too. I want this war to end.But we have to be clear. There's language being used. And I think some of it's on each side. We saw what happened in UCLA as well.The minute you use threatening language, the minute use exclusionary language, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism? That's not progressive. That's not democratic. That should not be allowed. And I think college campuses have a right to crack down on that kind of situation, because it creates an atmosphere of threat.Remember, these universities have a responsibility, to keep their kids safe, and ensure that they feel safe, that they can go about their education, not expecting to be confronted in a way that could be physically threatening.And so, right now, I would say, as a Democrat, as a progressive, we need to come to grips with this. We need to be very blunt. Democrats should embrace that we do not allow any violence, any anti-Semitism, any Islamophobia. And I think if we don't do that, the Republicans are going to weaponize this issue, for the fall election.[21:40:00]So, I would further say, if you care about this country, from my perspective, you care about Joe Biden being elected? Then let's stop fooling around here. We have to condemn any kind of violence, any kind of exclusion. You can't have any tolerance for anti-Semitism, for example. It will poison the well, politically and morally.COLLINS: Former New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, thank you for joining us here, on set, tonight.DE BLASIO: Thank you, Kaitlan. COLLINS: Up next, speaking of how Republicans are using this, you have seen Donald Trump blaming them, on President Biden, who has also been pretty quiet about this issue.The question is what does it mean for November? We'll talk about it with our experts right after this.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)COLLINS: The former President has made clear, in his public comments, that he sees these images, of police arresting college students by the dozens, amid these nationwide protests, as good for him politically.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: They went into one of the big buildings, a beautiful landmark building. Boy, they got the -- it got the hell beat out of it last night.It was a beautiful thing to watch. New York's finest.(AUDIENCE CHEERS)(END VIDEO CLIP)[21:45:00]COLLINS: Those comments fit a pattern that we have seen from Donald Trump. We've heard from his own former Defense Secretary, Mark Esper, who wrote in his book, \"A Sacred Oath,\" about Trump asking, \"Can't you just shoot them?\" about George Floyd demonstrators.The way Trump talks about protests is harkened back to a racist history that we have seen in this country, of a police brutality, including when Trump once tweeted \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\"Even when the protest was peaceful, on the sidelines of a football game, Trump wanted those NFL players removed.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)TRUMP: Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, get that son of a bitch off the field right now.(AUDIENCE CHEERS)(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: Meanwhile, the person in the Oval Office, right now, President Biden has said quite little about the unrest that we are seeing on campuses.The White House, today, tried to answer questions about his relative silence by saying no president has been more forceful about combating anti-Semitism than he has.Here to talk about all this tonight:Cornell William Brooks, the former President and CEO of the NAACP and a Harvard professor.And David Frum, a staff writer for The Atlantic, and a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush.And, David, let me start with you.Because Biden has been quite silent about this. I mean, there was that one moment, on Earth Day, where he was asked, and he kind of had this statement that even some Democrats believed was a bit ambivalent.And I just wonder, do you -- is this a moment for the President to be speaking out more, in your view?DAVID FRUM, STAFF WRITER, THE ATLANTIC: Well, let's bracket something. You set this up by introducing remarks from former President Donald Trump, who incited the worst violent attack on the authority, of the U.S. federal government, the worst domestic violent attack, on the authority of the U.S. government since the Civil War. So, he doesn't have any standing here.But the issue for President Biden is one of whether he is going to seem firm or weak.The great question -- there are two great questions that haunt each of the two parties.The great question, with any Republican leader is, are you uncaring? And Republicans have to constantly reassure people that they can -- they can have humanity, that they care, that they have respect, that they regard -- they have an understanding of the equality of all Americans.The great question, fairly or unfairly over Democrats, is always are they too weak to stand up against the forces of disorder in society?So, President Biden doesn't have an anti-Semitism probably, exactly, because everyone understands that he stood with Israel, he stands with the Jewish people. He's got a long record of that.The question is, will he enforce authority, both against the kind of violent rioters who attacked the Capitol, both -- and against the violent rioters, who are attacking campuses. Not that those are equally important, because obviously attacking the government is worse than attacking a campus. But they are the same psychology. And he has to stand for law in all cases, against all challengers to law.COLLINS: Cornell, I wonder how you see that, and what the President's role in, in speaking out on this is.CORNELL WILLIAM BROOKS, PROFESSOR, HARVARD UNIVERSITY: I would very much agree with David, that President Biden has a long history of standing with the Jewish community, of standing with Israel and standing against anti-Semitism.Where I might differ is that, President Biden is looking at across the landscape of America, and he's probably taking note of the fact that there are many protests, many demonstrations, overwhelmingly non- violent. And he's looking at college campuses, where there are people, who had engaged in violence, who have taken over buildings, where law enforcement has had to respond.But there are moments where you can question how they're responding, when they should respond, who, what else can we do, to prevent these kinds of eruptions of violence?And he's looking across the country, and I suspect that he would much rather not make a bumper-sticker response, or rather, respond thoughtfully, carefully, in a way that's tailored to the place we find ourselves as a country.And so, I'm not sure if it's silence, or is it being thoughtful, as opposed to what we've heard from the former President.COLLINS: David, I wonder, one thing we've also heard.And that's a really good point, Cornell, about the comparison here.But I wonder, we also are hearing comparisons to 1968.FRUM: Yes.COLLINS: And I wonder how you view that, David?FRUM: I think it's nonsense.Look, many of the rioters have seen YouTube videos of 1968, and think they know the history. But the police have actually learned from the history.And this is one of the reasons I wrote for The Atlantic, why I think there -- that the small cadre of really violent people, who imagined disrupting the Democratic convention, are kidding themselves.The 1968 convention, security was provided by an unprofessional, overly emotional, bigoted Chicago police force, under local control.[21:50:00]Modern conventions are national security special events, security is provided by the Secret -- so the federal government provides about $50 million to each convention for security. It's directed at both conventions by the Secret Service. They can call on not only the resources of that particular city, but the whole state, and indeed, the resources of the federal government, including the Department of Defense and the Coast Guard of the cities on the water.I was at the 2004 Republican convention, at the peak of anti-Iraq War mobilization, a much bigger protest movement than this on campus, with much wider social support. There were 1,800 arrests in 2004. It did not disrupt the Republican convention that year, because the police were able to enforce perimeters.And with all of these demonstrations, the key to lawful peaceful protest is for the police to be clear. Here's where the boundary is. If you're on this side of the fence, and if you follow certain rules, non-attack (ph) people, you can speak. If you cross the perimeter, we arrest you.COLLINS: Yes, I mean, it's a big question.And Cornell, also, I mean, just, seeing this going forward, final word from you on that.WILLIAM BROOKS: Sure. Let us take note of this. The past is a lesson book. It is not a mirror.So when we look at 1968, and look at Columbia, we look at Cornell, in 1969, Jackson State and Kent State University in 1970. The lessons are that when the police come in, when the National Guard comes in, we can't always predict what will happen. Students may be killed. Students may be hurt. Bystanders may be hurt.So, the lessons of the past is we need to be thoughtful, we need to be careful. But it -- the past is not a mirror. The student protests and demonstrations up to date are not nearly as large as they were a generation ago, or even two years ago.So, this is a moment, where out of concern and caution, for Jewish students, but students more generally--COLLINS: Yes.WILLIAM BROOKS: --we all have a role to play. It's not really a matter of when we call in the police, and what they do, this also what college administrators do up until the point of a crisis.COLLINS: It's a great question.WILLIAM BROOKS: And presidential candidates and all of us as commentators.COLLINS: Yes.WILLIAM BROOKS: So, in other words, let's think about this way. We have to think about students as not merely demonstrators, today, but as citizens of tomorrow, and let's stand by them, and help them improve this democracy.COLLINS: Yes, it's a great question. We'll see what it looks like going forward.Cornell William Brooks, David Frum, thank you both.FRUM: Yes.COLLINS: As one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation is going into effect today in Florida, Vice President Kamala Harris was there, blaming former President Donald Trump. You'll want to hear her comments, right after a quick break.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[21:57:04]COLLINS: Lawmakers in Arizona voted, tonight, to throw out a near- total abortion ban from the Civil War era, in that key battleground state, just three weeks after we saw the Supreme Court there, in that state, revive it.Today, also in Florida, one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the nation went into effect.Vice President Harris was in Jacksonville, today. And she blamed one person by name for it all.(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Across our nation, we witness a full-on assault state by state on reproductive freedom.And understand who is to blame. Former President Donald Trump did this.(AUDIENCE CHEERS & APPLAUSE)(END VIDEO CLIP)COLLINS: And Ashley Allison and Margaret Hoover are both here with me.And Ashley, I just wonder what you thought of how the administration has been using Vice President Harris, and deploying her, very specifically, to Florida, the day this ban went into effect.ASHLEY ALLISON, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think it's important.COLLINS: This six-week law. Let me be clear.ALLISON: Yes. Which I will say is a ban.COLLINS: I just saw Ron DeSantis tweeting.ALLISON: Yes, yes, sure.COLLINS: I want to make sure I have it right.ALLISON: I will say, use that word that it is basically a ban at six weeks, as most women don't even know they're pregnant at that point.I think it's important that the Vice President continues to go, not just to battleground states, but even to states that are traditionally more conservative, like a Kansas or a Montana, where those restrictions are playing, are going into effect as well. And voters are standing up, and saying that's not the way we want our government to be, and our doctors, and making decisions about our life. So, this is not just a battleground issue state. This is a state thatis affecting women and families across the country. And so, it's really important that the Vice President's voice, and the President's voice are being used in the campaign, but also in the administration, to protect reproductive justice and freedom for women.COLLINS: Yes, especially Florida, because all the neighboring states also have similar restrictive laws.ALLISON: Yes.COLLINS: In Arizona, though, when they're voting to repeal that Civil War era near-ban, only two Republicans broke with their party, and voted with Democrats to do so.MARGARET HOOVER, CNN POLITICAL CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. And it was -- it was a same very, very small vote in the House of Representatives, even the week before in the State House that did it. I think it were three Republicans in the State House. Of course, they only have a one-vote majority in both of those houses. So it's enormously close.And I think that's the answer, is the stakes were so high, for Republicans and for Arizona. I think the Trump team breathes a sigh of relief, tonight, actually, because this was catalyzing, and going to catalyze so much mobilization of new voters in Arizona.It probably still will, because abortion will probably still be a ballot amendment in Arizona. But it won't probably have the thrust of energy that it would have had, if there had been a near total ban on abortion, except for the life of the mother.COLLINS: Yes.HOOVER: Come November.COLLINS: Well, it's also kind of created a rift among Republicans of, are we in support of this or do we want it to stay in?[22:00:00]ALLISON: Yes, I just think -- I know that they did this act. But for the next 90 days, women still won't have access to reproductive justice.But the important thing is that they're doing it, right now, for politics, because they don't want to lose the election. What happens after the election? That's what voters need to pay attention to, and keep that energy around for November.COLLINS: We'll see what it looks like. Of course, the administration taking full advantage of it.Ashley Allison, Margaret Hoover, great to have you both here, on set, tonight.Thank you all so much, for joining us, tonight. We'll see you back here, tomorrow.\"CNN NEWSNIGHT WITH ABBY PHILLIP\" starts right now."

                "title": "JD Vance, author of ‘Hillbilly Elegy,’ enters large, pro-Trump GOP field for Ohio Senate seat | CNN Politics",
                "text_body": "The Republican primary forOhio’s open Senate seatgot even more crowded Thursday with the entry of best-selling author J.D. Vance – setting up a messy fight for the GOP nomination in a state that voted for former President Donald Trump twice. At a kickoff rally Thursday night in his hometown of Middletown, near Cincinnati, Vance delivered a populist message, with large corporations, big tech firms and “public health leadership” in the crosshairs. He also promised to fight for the grandmothers who believe in a secure border and for the “middle-class worker.” “I want to be not just a fighter, but a fighter who’s fighting for you,” Vance said from behind a lectern where, moments before his announcement, a campaign sign had fallen down. Vance joinsa fieldthat already includes Josh Mandel, the former state treasurer; Jane Timken, the former chair of the Ohio Republican Party; and businessmen Bernie Moreno and Mike Gibbons. The primary race to succeed retiringSen. Rob Portman, a relatively moderate Republican, could turn on who appears to be the most authentically pro-Trump candidate. “There has never been a Republican primary for statewide office in Ohio this wide open and this chaotic,” said one Republican strategist familiar with Ohio. “Each one of these candidates has their own claim to the Republican base.” The knives were already out for Vance before the 36-year-old venture capitalist joined the race. Earlier this week, Ohio Republicans received anonymous text messages blasting Vance as a “Never Trumper.” The texts are similar to a flurry of messages sent to voters in April,denouncing Vance shortly after he announced he was exploring a Senate run. Most Ohio Republicans doubt Trump will endorse until closer to the May 3 primary next year, but the fight over his mantle is on. Mandel, for instance, has taken on the role of pro-Trump culture warrior, releasing a video last month of himself burning a protective mask to protest Covid-19 restrictions. The more establishment-aligned Timken can point to Trump’s support for her as Ohio GOP chair in January 2017. And Vance has taken up Trump’s criticisms of “Big Tech” – aligning him with the Trump donor and Silicon Valley gadfly Peter Thiel, who earlier this year pledged $10 million to a pro-Vance super PAC. Trump’s centrality in the GOP primary reflects how the former president remains a political force in the Buckeye State. Trump won the state twice, earning more than 3 million votes in 2020 and improving his share of the vote from four years earlier by 2 percentage points. Once considered a perennial swing state, Ohio has trended toward the GOP for the past decade. In that time, Republicans have held every state executive office and the majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Since 2010, only two Democrats have been able to win statewide in Ohio: Barack Obama in his 2012 reelection bid and Sen. Sherrod Brown, who won reelection in 2012 and again in 2018. Trump’s ascendance has accelerated the GOP’s takeover, allowing the party to corner the White working-class vote that Democrats have struggled to keep in the fold. Amid their own primary battle, Republicans are trying to define the Democrats’ leading candidate,Rep. Tim Ryan, as someone who is captured by his party’s left wing and out of touch with Ohioans. “As Tim Ryan seeks a promotion, he is trending more and more leftward to appease his liberal bosses – Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, AOC and Bernie Sanders,” said Lizzie Litzow of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “He is in lockstep with these radicals on issues like open borders that have led to the outrageous crisis at our Southern Border and abolishing the filibuster – a blatant power grab.” Hoping for a reversal in their fortunes, Democrats in Ohio and nationally are counting on a chaotic and messy Republican primary to give their nominee a chance. “Their chaos is our opportunity,” said Liz Walters, chair of the Ohio Democratic Party. “These Republican candidates are so desperately running their campaigns for an audience of one, for Trump.” Ryan declined to be interviewed for this story. This competition came to a head in Wellington, Ohio, on Saturday, where each of the top Republican candidates treated Trump’s rally at the Lorain County Fairgrounds as a proving ground. Leading into the rally, Timken ran a radio ad touting her Trump credentials. On the day of, she had a plane flying over the rallygoers touting her campaign and had campaign volunteers around the event to meet voters. Gibbons hosted a pro-Trump tailgate before the rally and had volunteers and the event. Both Mandel and Moreno took a more casual approach to the event – they attended but mostly just mingled with people. Trump – in Ohio to kick off his revenge tour against Republicans who haven’t been loyal to him – clearly enjoyed the competition vying for his base’s support. Standing on stage deep into his rally, the former President began to play up the divisions. “Hey, do you want to take a poll,” Trump exclaimed about the Senate race, throwing the crowd of supporters into the contentious affair. When Trump mentioned Timken, the former state party chair earned a smattering of cheers, groans and boos. Mandel, who has tailored his campaign narrowly to Trump’s base, earned more hearty applause, while the response to Gibbons – more of an unknown in the race – was more muted. The former President, seemingly sensing the divisions, said, “I think we’ll get out of this poll stuff,” before mentioning Moreno. The tension at the Trump rally was just the latest – and possibly most public – chapter of an already frenzied race, one that has seen the candidates already fighting. Mandel, the 43-year-old Marine veteran, is considered the current frontrunner even by those supporting his rivals. Thanks to his two terms as state treasurer, he has high name identification and connections with conservative groups and leaders in Ohio. Mandel also brings a considerable amount of campaign dollars – more than $4 million – left unspent from his short-lived 2018 run for Senate, when he dropped out months before the primary. “If the election were today, Josh would win,” said one adviser to another GOP candidate. But Mandel is also facing headwinds in the early months of his current campaign. The Columbus Dispatch reported in May that three of Mandel’s fundraisers had left the campaign, followed by a report this week that two of those staff members departed because of a “toxic work environment” created by Mandel’s girlfriend and finance director, Rachel Wilson. Mandel declined to comment to CNN about those reports. Mandel’s most direct competition appears to be Timken, who comes to the race without the experience in elected office but with a formidable organization – including committee chairs in all of Ohio’s 88 counties. Timken also has access to financial and political resources through her husband, Tim Timken, a former steel executive who is a lobbyist in Columbus. Timken has faulted other candidates “who have based President Trump, refused to campaign for him or quit the tough fights” – something she has done regularly on campaign literature that calls out her opponents by name. Mandel has regularly attacked Timken, casting her as someone not entirely loyal to Trump and tying her to former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican who has drawn the ire of Trump loyalists. Much of Mandel’s focus on Timken has centered around Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, the Republican congressman who voted in favor of impeaching Trump earlier this year. The Ohio Republican Party later censured Gonzalez and called for him to resign. Timken carefully defended Gonzalez after his vote, touting his record as a legislator and opening up a line of attack for Mandel. “Question: Why did Jane Timken refuse to censure Gonzalez when she was Chairman? She clearly had time to do so,” Mandel tweeted in May. “So what’s the real reason?” Vance enters the Senate race as something of a wild card. Known primarily for his best-selling memoir Hillbilly Elegy, the Yale Law School graduate and venture capitalist has emerged as an authoritative voice on the White-working class that makes up the base of Trump’s support in the GOP. But Vance’s political fate could come down to how he talks about his transformation on Trump, who he publicly opposed in 2016 before reversing his position in 2020. During the 2016 campaign, Vance wrote in USA Today, “Trump’s actual policy proposals, such as they are, range from immoral to absurd.” The same year, as it became clear Trump would become the GOP presidential nominee, Vance wrote in The Atlantic that “Trump is cultural heroin,” who “makes some feel better for a bit.” “He cannot fix what ails them, and one day they’ll realize it,” added Vance. As the anonymous text message demonstrates, Vance is already facing attacks for his past opposition to Trump. Some of that will come from the national conservative movement, which has begun to coalesce around Mandel. The Club for Growth’s political action committee, which endorsed Mandel in March, released a statement Wednesday night going after Vance. “He claims to be a Trump Republican, but in the short time Mr. Vance has been active in politics he’s spent the bulk of it tearing down President Trump and mocking Trump voters,” said the Club’s president, David McIntosh. Nevertheless, Vance’s allies say he is the most authentic candidate in the field because he can express so well why Trump became president. (They also point out that some of his opponents, including Mandel, first supported other Republicans in the 2016 Ohio presidential primary.) Earlier this year, Vance met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. He also attended his rally last week in Ohio. And his connection with Thiel may further help soften any bad feelings Trump could have for Vance. A spokesman for the Thiel-backed super PAC, Protect Ohio Values, told CNN that Vance “believes deeply in President Trump’s America First agenda and is laser focused on fighting for policies that will benefit Ohio’s mighty Middle Class.” “Ohioans want elected leaders with the spine to stand up to Washington’s corrupt political class and we’re confident that JD Vance is the only candidate in this race who fits that bill,” added the spokesman. The Republican strategist familiar with Ohio called Vance a “different kind of candidate” with an idiosyncratic style and issue-set who could break out if primary voters find themselves underwhelmed by Mandel and Timken. That jibes with the overwhelming sense from Ohio Republicans that, barring an intervention by Trump, anything could happen. “This could be the wildest primary of the cycle,” said the GOP strategist.

                "text_body": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time As President Joe Biden’s campaign seeks to rebound from his rough debate performance two weeks ago, it has increasingly tried to turn the attention to former President Donald Trump about Project 2025, an expansive conservative plan backed by more than 100 groups for Trump’s potential second administration. Over the last week, Trump has tried to put some distance between himself and Project 2025. \"I know nothing about Project 2025,\"he said in a Truth Social post Friday.\"I have no idea who is behind it.” He doubled downin a social media post Thursday morning, saying, \"I have not seen it, have no idea who is in charge of it, and, unlike our very well received Republican Platform, had nothing to do with it.\" But many of Trump’s key allies have been directly involved in producing the project, which includesa 900-plus page policy road mapand personnel database gathered by the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank leading the effort. Trump also spoke highly about the group's plans at a dinner sponsored by the Heritage Foundation in April 2022, saying: “This is a great group, and they’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do and what your movement will do when the American people give us a colossal mandate to save America.” The project’s website bills it as a “governing agenda” that would “pave the way for an effective conservative Administration.” The website also notes that the project isbacked by over 100 conservative organizations, many led by close allies of Trump, including Turning Point USA, the Center for Renewing America, the Claremont Institute, the Family Policy Alliance, the Family Research Council, Moms for Liberty and America First Legal — the latter of which is led by Stephen Miller, a top former Trump adviser. Former Trump administration officials who have been directly affiliated with Project 2025 include former Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, former deputy chief of staff Rick Dearborn and former Justice Department senior counsel Gene Hamilton. Vought, one of the key authors of Project 2025, is also the Republican National Committee’s platform policy director. The RNC this month adopted its official policy platform for the 2024 election cycle, a document that is less conservative than the Project 2025 handbook —including on key issues like abortion. Despite the differences between the official platform and Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation is intertwined with the RNC and has been for years. A spokesperson for the Heritage Foundation told NBC News that it will have a sponsored presence at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, as it did at the GOP conventions in 2016 and 2012. The group was also intimately involved with Trump's transition to the White House in 2016. Beginning that August, top Heritage officials — including Ed Meese, Ed Feulner, Bill Walton and Kay Coles James — became key players in identifying personnel to fill out the administration. The Trump campaign declined to comment on who could be a part of a 2025 transition team. Typically, a party’s nominee selects a transition team several months before the general election. In a statement to NBC News, Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitka called Project 2025 \"extreme,\" and said it's, \"written and led by [Trump's] own inner circle — the same extremists who stacked Trump’s first administration with loyalists and fired anyone who opposed his dangerous instincts, and the same enablers who will help Trump go even further to ‘terminate’ the Constitution, get ‘revenge’ on his enemies, and govern as a ‘dictator on day one’ if he wins this November. Donald Trump and Project 2025 are one in the same — and they’re both going to lose this November.” Although the RNC’s official platform and Project 2025 differ, the goals espoused in Project 2025 are similar to some ofthe campaign promises Trump makesat his rallies. He has promised to cut the Education Department, mirroring Project 2025’s proposal that “the federal Department of Education should be eliminated.” He has also promised to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Biden, alleging that the justice system under the Biden administration is “two-tiered” and “weaponized.” Project 2025’s handbookechoes that, saying the Biden administration has executed an “unprecedented politicization and weaponization of the [Justice] department,” which demands “a comprehensive response from the next Administration.” Still, Trump’s campaign denies that the authors of Project 2025 are in any way shaping his plans for a potential administration. Senior campaign advisers Chris LaCivita and Susie Wiles said in a statement last year that “unless a message is coming directly from President Trump or an authorized member of his campaign team, no aspect of future presidential staffing or policy announcements should be deemed official.” Vaughn Hillyard is a correspondent for NBC News.

                "text_body": "Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved. Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, speaks during a campaign event Tuesday, July 30, 2024, in Henderson, Nev. (AP Photo/Ellen Schmidt) Follow AP’s coverage of thepresidential election. Ohio Sen.JD Vance, Donald Trump’s running mate, praised the vision of Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts in the foreword of a forthcoming book that could conflict with the Trump campaign’seffort to distance itselffrom Heritage’s Project 2025 transition effort. The Associated Press obtained a copy of the foreword to Roberts’ forthcoming book “Dawn’s Early Light” on Tuesday, the same day of a shakeup at Project 2025, which has become an important election-year issue as Democrats and others argue thatthe nearly 1,000-page vision it set out is extreme. “Never before has a figure with Roberts’s depth and stature within the American Right tried to articulate a genuinely new future for conservatism,” Vance writes in his foreword. “The Heritage Foundation isn’t some random outpost on Capitol Hill; it is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan to Donald Trump.” Vance’s words, which echo Roberts’ frequent calls to tear down U.S. institutions entirely to start anew, show the overlap between Trump’s closest allies and the people fueling Project 2025. Still, Vance spokesman William Martin distanced Vance and the Trump campaign from Project 2025 in a statement on Tuesday. “The foreword has nothing to do with Project 2025. Senator Vance has previously said that he has no involvement with it and has plenty of disagreements with what they’re calling for,” Martin wrote in an email. “Only President Trump will set the policy agenda for the next administration.”  Trump’s top aides have repeatedly criticized organizers of Project 2025 for what they say is a false impression that the transition effort is associated with the campaign. After Tuesday’s shakeup at Heritage, Roberts is now leading Project 2025 operations directly. The book, scheduled to be published on Sept. 24, outlines a vision for what its publisher calls “a peaceful ‘Second American Revolution’.” Its subtitle is “Taking Back Washington to Save America,” thoughearlier descriptionsof the book listed it as “Burning Down Washington to Save America.” Thepublisher’s descriptionsays it identifies institutions that conservatives need to build or to take back, adding that some are “too corrupt to save.” Among those it lists are Ivy League colleges, the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the Department of Education and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Also, on Tuesday, Paul Dans, who had directed Project 2025,left the Heritage Foundationamid continued criticism of the plan. Roberts said his departure came after the project completed what it set out to do. In his foreword, Vance calls for something more than removing bad policies of the past, but instead to “rebuild.” “We need an offensive conservatism, not merely one that tries to prevent the left from doing things we don’t like,” Vance writes. As Vance wraps up, he quotes Roberts as saying that when twilight descends and a person hears wolves, “You’ve got to circle the wagons and load the muskets.” “We are now all realizing that it’s time to circle the wagons and load the muskets,” Vance adds. “In the fights that lay ahead, these ideas are an essential weapon.” What to know about the 2024 election: News outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results.

DNC spokesman Alex Floyd said in a statement that Vance’s language “echoes the same dangerous rhetoric we’ve heard from him and Donald Trump for years.” The New Republic was first to report the contents of the foreword in full. Vance also writes about things he and Roberts have in common, including difficult upbringings, influential grandparents, and the Catholic faith. He also writes about parenthood, which has been a contentious issue for him recently afteran interview resurfacedwhere he said Democrats running the country are “childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” In the book, he praises the idea that we should “encourage our kids to get married and have kids,” and teach them that marriage is a sacred union, ideas that he says come from “the old American Right that recognized — correctly, in my view — that cultural norms and attitudes matter.” Smith reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Swenson from New York.

                "text_body": "Donald Trumphas lately made clear he wants little to do with Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that has attracted considerable blowback in his race for the White House. “I have no idea who is behind it,” the former president recently claimed on social media. Many people Trump knows quite well are behind it. Six of his former Cabinet secretaries helped write or collaborated on the 900-page playbook for a second Trump term published by the Heritage Foundation. Four individuals Trump nominated as ambassadors were also involved, along with several enforcers of his controversial immigration crackdown. And about 20 pages are credited to his first deputy chief of staff. In fact, at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership,” the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch. Dozens more who staffed Trump’s government hold positions with conservative groups advising Project 2025, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and longtime adviser Stephen Miller. These groups also include several lawyers deeply involved in Trump’s attempts to remain in power, such as his impeachment attorney Jay Sekulow and two of the legal architects of his failed bid to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Cleta Mitchell and John Eastman. To quantify the scope of the involvement from Trump’s orbit, CNN reviewed online biographies, LinkedIn profiles and news clippings for more than 1,000 people listed on published directories for the 110 organizations on Project 2025’s advisory board, as well as the 200-plus names credited with working on “Mandate for Leadership.” Overall, CNN found nearly 240 people with ties to both Project 2025 and to Trump, covering nearly every aspect of his time in politics and the White House – from day-to-day foot soldiers in Washington to the highest levels of his government. The number is likely higher because many individuals’ online résumés were not available. In addition to people who worked directly for Trump, others who participated in Project 2025 were appointed by the former president to independent positions. For instance, Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr authored an entire chapter of proposed changes to his agency, and Lisa Correnti, an anti-abortion advocate Trump appointed as a delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, is among the contributors. Several people involved in Project 2025 didn’t serve in the Trump administration but were influential in shaping his first term. One example is former US Attorney Brett Tolman, a leading force behind the former president’s criminal justice reform law who laterhelped arrange a pardon for Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law. Tolman is listed as a contributor to “Mandate for Leadership.” The extensive overlap between Project 2025 and Trump’s universe of allies, advisers and former staff complicates his efforts to distance himself from the work. Trump’s campaign has sought for months to make clear that Project 2025 doesn’t speak for them amid an intensifying push by President Joe Biden and Democrats to tie the Republican standard bearer to the playbook’s more controversial policies. In a statement to CNN, campaign spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez said Trump only endorses the Republican Party platform and the agenda posted on the former president’s website. “Team Biden and the (Democratic National Committee) are lying and fear-mongering because they have nothing else to offer the American people,” Alvarez said. Behind Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation, a 51-year-old conservative organization that aligned itself with Trump not long after his 2016 victory. Heritage is led by Kevin Roberts, a Trump ally whom the former president praised as “doing an unbelievable job” on a February night when they shared the same stage. Heritage conceived Project 2025 to begin planning so a Republican president could hit the ground running after the election. One of its priorities is creating a roadmap for the first 180 days of the new administration to quickly reorient every federal agency around its conservative vision. Described on its website as “a movement-wide effort guided by the conservative cause to address and reform the failings of big government and an undemocratic administrative state,” Project 2025 also aims to recruit and train thousands of people loyal to the conservative movement to fill federal government positions. One organization advising Project 2025, American Accountability Foundation, is also putting together a roster of current federal workers it suspects could impede Trump’s plans for a second term. Heritage ispaying the group $100,000 for its work. Many of Project 2025’s priorities are aligned with the former president, especially on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracies. Both Trump and Project 2025 have called for eliminating the Department of Education. But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn’t explicitly backed. Within “Mandate for Leadership” are plans toban pornography,reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, exclude the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, make it harder for transgender adults to transition, and eliminate the federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service. Its voluminous and detailed plans also run counter to Trump’s desire fora streamlined GOP platformabsent any language that Democrats could wield against Republicans this cycle. Roberts recently faced backlash as well for saying in an interview that the country was “in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.” Three days later, Trump posted to Truth Social: “I know nothing about Project 2025.” “I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,” he wrote. In response to Trump’s social media post, a Project 2025 spokesperson told CNN in a statement it “does not speak for any candidate or campaign.” “It is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to use,” the spokesperson said. Trump’s campaign has repeatedly said in recent months that “reports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical” and don’t represent the former president’s plans. Project 2025 and similar policy proposals coming from outside Trump’s campaign are “merely suggestions,” campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in a statement. However, Trump’s attempts to distance himself from Project 2025 have already encountered credibility challenges. The person overseeing Project 2025, Paul Dans, was a top official in Trump’s White House who has previously said he hopes to work for his former boss again. Shortly after Trump’s Truth Social post last week, Democrats noted a recruitment video for Project 2025 features a Trump campaign spokeswoman. On Tuesday, the Biden campaign posted dozens of examples of connections between Trump and Project 2025. CNN’s review of Project 2025’s contributors also demonstrated the breadth of Trump’s reach through the upper ranks of the vast network of organizations working to move the country in a conservative direction – from women’s groups and Christian colleges to conservative think tanks in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi. New organizations centered around Trump’s political movement, his conspiracy theories around his electoral defeats and his first-term policies are deeply involved in Project 2025 as well. One of the advisory groups, America First Legal, was started by Miller, a key player in forming Trump’s immigration agenda. Another is the Center for Renewing America, founded by Russ Vought, former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote for Project 2025 a detailed blueprint for consolidating executive power. Vought recently oversaw the Republican Party committee that drafted the new platform heavily influenced by Trump. In addition to Vought, two other former Trump Cabinet secretaries wrote chapters for “Mandate for Leadership”: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Three more former department heads – National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe, acting Transportation Secretary Steven Bradbury and acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella – are listed as contributors. Project 2025’s proposals for reforming the country’s immigration laws appear heavily influenced by those who helped execute Trump’s early enforcement measures. Former acting US Customs and Border Protection chiefMark Morganand former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chiefTom Homan– the faces of Trump’s polarizing policies – contributed to the project, as did Kathy Nuebel Kovarik,one of the policy advisers pushing to end certain immigrant protections behind the scenes. The Project 2025 chapter on overhauling the Department of Homeland Security was written by Ken Cuccinelli, a top official at the department under Trump. Some of Trump’s most contentious and high-profile hires are credited with working on “Mandate for Leadership,” including some whose tenures ended under a cloud of controversy. Before Trump adviser Peter Navarro went to prison for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena as part of the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, he wrote a section defending the former president’s trade policies and advocating for punitive tariffs. Other contributors include: Michael Pack, a conservative filmmaker who orchestrated a mass firing at the US Agency for Global Media after he was installed by Trump; Frank Wuco, a senior White House adviser who oncepromoted far-right conspiracieson his talk radio show, including lies about President Barack Obama’s citizenship; former NOAA official David Legates, a notable climate change skepticinvestigated for posting dubious research with the White House imprint; and Mari Stull, a wine blogger-turned-lobbyist who left the Trump administrationamid accusations she was hunting for disloyal State Department employees. The culmination of their work, spread across 900 pages, touches every corner of the executive branch and would drastically change the federal government as well as everyday life for many Americans. In summarizing the undertaking, Roberts wrote in “Mandate for Leadership” that Project 2025 represented “the next conservative President’s last opportunity to save our republic.” “Conservatives have just two years and one shot to get this right,” Roberts said. “With enemies at home and abroad, there is no margin for error. Time is running short. If we fail, the fight for the very idea of America may be lost.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

Tom Jones, a political activist and former Capitol Hill aide to Republican senators, is pictured in Bardstown, Ky., Tuesday, June 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Timothy D. Easley) Follow AP’s coverage of thepresidential election. WASHINGTON (AP) — From his home office in small-town Kentucky, a seasoned political operative is quietly investigating scores of federal employees suspected of being hostile to the policies of RepublicanDonald Trump, a highly unusual and potentially chilling effort that dovetails with broaderconservative preparationsfor a new White House. Tom Jones and his American Accountability Foundation are digging into the backgrounds, social media posts and commentary of key high-ranking government employees, starting with theDepartment of Homeland Security. They’re relying in part on tips from his network of conservative contacts, including workers. In a move that alarms some, they’re preparing to publish the findings online. With a $100,000 grant fromthe Heritage Foundation, the goal is to post 100 names of government workers to a website this summer to show a potential new administration who might be standing in the way ofa second-term Trump agenda— and ripe for scrutiny,reclassifications, reassignments or firings. “We need to understand who these people are and what they do,” said Jones, a former Capitol Hill aide to Republican senators. The concept of compiling and publicizing a list of government employees shows the lengths Trump’s allies are willing to go to ensure nothing or no one will block his plans in a potential second term. Jones’ Project Sovereignty 2025 comes asHeritage’s Project 2025lays the groundwork, with policies, proposals and personnel ready for a possible new White House.  The effort, focused on top career government officials who aren’t appointees within the political structure, has stunned democracy experts and shocked the civil service community in what they compare with the red scare of McCarthyism. Jacqueline Simon, policy director at the American Federation of Government Employees, said the language being used — the Heritage Foundation’s announcement praised the group for ferreting out “anti-American bad actors” — is “shocking.” Civil servants are often ex-military personnel and are required to take an oath to the Constitution to work for the federal government, not a loyalty test to a president, she and others said. “It just seems as though their goal is to try to menace federal employees and sow fear,” said Simon, whose union backs PresidentJoe Biden, a Democrat, forreelection. As Trump, who has beenconvicted of felony chargesin a hush money case and is under afour-count federal indictmentaccusing him ofworking to overturn his 2020 election loss, faces a likely rematch with Biden this fall, far-right conservatives have vowed to take a wrecking ball to what they call the deep-state bureaucracy. The Trump campaign has said outside groups don’t speak for the ex-president, who alone sets hispolicy priorities. Conservatives view the federal workforce as overstepping its role to become a power center that can drive or thwart a president’s agenda. Particularly during the Trump administration, government officials came under attack from the White House and Republicans on Capitol Hill, as his own Cabinet often raised objections to some of his more singular or even unlawful proposals. While Jones’ group won’t necessarily be recommending whether to fire or reassign the federal workers it lists, the work aligns with Heritage’s far-reaching Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration.

Support us.Donate to the AP. Heritage’sProject 2025proposes reviving the Trump Schedule F policy that would try to reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers as political appointees, which could enable mass dismissals — althougha Biden administration ruleseeks to make that more difficult. The Heritage project is working to recruit and train a new generation to travel to Washington to fill government jobs. In announcing the $100,000 Innovation Award last month, Heritage said it’d support American Accountability Foundation’s “investigative researchers, in-depth reports, and educational efforts to alert Congress, a conservative administration, and the American people to the presence of anti-American bad actors burrowed into the administrative state and ensure appropriate action is taken.” Heritage President Kevin Roberts said the “weaponization of the federal government” has been possible only because of the “deep state of entrenched Leftist bureaucrats.” He said he was proud to support the work of American Accountability Foundation workers “in their fight to hold our government accountable and drain it of bad actors.” The federal government employs about 2.2 million people, including those in the Washington, D.C., area and workers who the unions say many Americans know as friends or neighbors in communities across the country. About 4,000 positions in the government are considered political appointees who routinely change from one presidential administration to the next, but most are career professionals — from landscapers at Veterans Administration cemeteries to economists at the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The public list-making conjures for some the era of Joseph McCarthy, the senator who conducted grueling hearings into suspected communist sympathizers during the Cold War. The hearings were orchestrated by a top staffer, Roy Cohn, who became a confidant of a younger Trump. Skye Perryman, CEO of the advocacy group Democracy Forward, said it’s deeply disturbing and reminiscent of “the darker parts of American history.” Publicly naming government workers is an “intimidation tactic to try to chill the work of these civil servants,” she said, and part of a broader “retribution agenda” underway this election. “They’re seeking to undermine our democracy,” she said. “They’re seeking to undermine the way that our government works for people.” Jones, from his desk overlooking rickhouses storing barrels in the Bourbon Capitol of Bardstown, scoffed at comparisons to McCarthyism as “nonsense.” He’s a former staffer to then-Sen. Jim DeMint, the South Carolina conservative Republican who later led Heritage and now helms the Conservative Policy Institute, where American Accountability Foundation has a mailing address. Jones also worked for Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, and provided opposition research for Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz’s 2016 presidential bid. With six researchers, Jones’ team operates remotely across the country, poring over the information about federal workers within Homeland Security, the State Department and other agencies that deal with immigration and border issues. Their focus is on the highest ranks of the civil servants — GS-13, GS-14 and GS-15 employees and those in senior executive positions who could put up roadblocks to Trump’s plans for tighter borders and more deportations. “I think it’s important to the next administration to understand who those people are,” Jones said. He dismissed the risks that could be involved in publicly posting the names, salary information and other details of federal workers who have some level of privacy or the idea his group’s work could put employees’ livelihoods in jeopardy. “You don’t get to make policy and then say, ‘Hey, don’t scrutinize me,”’ he said. He acknowledges some of the work is often a “gut check” or “instinct” about which federal employees would be suspected of trying to block a conservative agenda. “We’re looking at, ‘Are there wrong people on the bus right now that are, you know, openly hostile to efforts to secure the southern border?’” he said. His own group came under scrutiny as it first probed Biden nominees. Biden had repealed Trump’s Schedule F executive order in January 2021, but a Government Accountability Office report in 2022 found that agencies believed it could be reinstated by a future administration. Since then, the Biden administrationissued a rulethat would make it harder to fire workers. A new administration could direct the Office of Personnel Management to undo the regulation, but the process would take time and be open to legal challenges. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

                "text_body": "Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign has falsely claimed on social media that a video clip from 2021 shows Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance endorsing a conservative initiative known as Project 2025. Project 2025, an effort to lay out an agenda for a potential second Donald Trump presidency, was organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank and developed along with a variety of other conservative organizations. The920-page Project 2025 blueprintfor right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have been a central focus of Democratic attacks during the 2024 election campaign. On the social media platform X on Saturday, the Harris campaignposted a videoof Vance being interviewed by conservative media outlet The Federalist. The Harris campaign account @KamalaHQ, which has more than one million followers, described the video like this: “JD Vance endorses Project 2025: ‘We really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power … I don’t think there’s a compromise that we’re gonna come with … Unless we overthrow them in some way, we’re gonna keep losing.’” Facts First:The Harris campaign’s claim that the video shows Vance endorsing Project 2025 is false. The video does not show Vance talking about Project 2025 at all. In fact, Project 2025 had not even been created at the time Vancemade these comments in May 2021. The initiative was launched by The Heritage Foundationin April 2022, and its policy recommendations werereleased in April 2023. The Harris campaign, which declined to comment for this article, did not acknowledge in the social media post that Vance’s comments were from more than three years ago. A Harris campaign official told CNN last week – when Harris herselfinaccurately describedsome of the contents of the Project 2025 policy document – that the campaign “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.” No broad endorsement from Vance or Trump There is no doubt that Trump and Vance have extensive ties to the people behind Project 2025. CNNpreviously reportedthat at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025. Vancewrote the forewardfor a forthcoming book by The Heritage Foundation president and Project 2025 architect Kevin Roberts. But Robertswas not yet working for Heritageat the time of the May 2021 Vance comments the Harris campaign posted on Saturday, and contrary to the Harris campaign’s claim, Vance has not issued a broad public endorsement of the initiative itself. Vancesaid earlier in July, days before he became Trump’s running mate, that Project 2025 includes “some good ideas” and “some things that I disagree with” – adding that “most importantly, it has no affiliation with the Trump campaign.” Trump hascalledunspecified Project 2025 proposals “seriously extreme”and“absolutely ridiculous and abysmal” but has alsosaid“many of the points are fine.” © 2024 Cable News Network.

                "text_body": "2024 Elections Kevin Roberts said the revolution will be bloodless “if the left allows it to be.” Kevin Roberts, president of The Heritage Foundation, speaks Feb. 22, 2024, in Nashville, Tennessee.   | George Walker IV/AP ByAssociated Press 07/04/2024 12:04 AM EDT Link Copied NEW YORK — The leader of a conservative think tank orchestrating plans for amassive overhaulof the federal government in the event of a Republican presidential win said that the country is in the midst of a “second American Revolution” that will be bloodless “if the left allows it to be.” Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts made the comments Tuesday on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast, adding that Republicans are “in the process of taking this country back.” Democrats are “apoplectic right now” because the right is winning, Roberts told former U.S. Rep. Dave Brat, one of the podcast’s guest hosts as Bannon is serving a four-month prison term. “And so I come full circle on this response and just want to encourage you with some substance that we are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.” Roberts’ remarks shed light on how a group that promises to have significant influence over a possible second term for former President Donald Trump is thinking about this moment in American politics. The Heritage Foundation is spearheading Project 2025, a sweeping road map for a new GOP administration that includes plans for dismantling aspects of the federal government and ousting thousands of civil servants in favor of Trump loyalists who will carry out a hard-right agenda without complaint. His call for revolution and vague reference to violence also unnerved some Democrats who interpreted it as threatening. “This is chilling,” former Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson wrote on the social platform X. “Their idea of a second American Revolution is to undo the first one.” James Singer, a spokesperson for President Joe Biden’s reelection campaign, pointed to this week’s Fourth of July holiday in an emailed statement. “248 years ago tomorrow America declared independence from a tyrannical king, and now Donald Trump and his allies want to make him one at our expense,” Singer said, adding that Trump and his allies are ”dreaming of a violent revolution to destroy the very idea of America.” Roberts, whose name Bannon recently floated to The New York Times as a potential chief of staff option for Trump, also said on the podcast that Republicans should be encouraged by the Supreme Court’s recent immunity ruling. He said Monday’s decision — which gives presidents broad immunity from prosecution — is “vital” to ensure a president won’t have to “second guess, triple guess every decision they’re making in their official capacity.” In an emailed statement on Wednesday, Roberts reiterated his comments from the podcast, saying Americans “are in the process of carrying out the Second American Revolution to take power back from the elites and despotic bureaucrats.” “These patriots are committed to peaceful revolution at the ballot box,” he said. “Unfortunately, it’s the Left that has a long history of violence, so it’s up to them to allow a peaceful transfer of power.” Roberts pointed to the protests after the killing of George Floyd by police in 2020, some of which erupted into crime, vandalism and violence. Democrats, in turn, have accused their Republican counterparts of violence, using the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot in which Trump supporters tried to forcibly overturn his loss to President Joe Biden. Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism, said Roberts’ comments about a “second American Revolution” are “a bit terrifying but also elucidating.” The 1,000-pageProject 2025 playbookcalls for far-reaching changes in government, including rolling back protections for the LGBTQ community and infusing Christianity more deeply into society. “Roberts, the Heritage Foundation, and its allies in Project 2025 want to reorder American society and fundamentally change it,” Beirich said. “He’s said the quiet part out loud.”  © 2024 POLITICO LLC"

EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Can we hear it for Kelly?  (Applause.) Good afternoon, North Carolina.  (Applause.)  Oh, it’s good to be back.  It’s good to be back.  And I want to thank Kelly for your work and for your family and all that you have given to our country in service. And it is so good to be back with so many incredible leaders — (applause) — including my dear friend, Roy Cooper.  (Applause.)  You know, Roy and I served together when I was attorney general of California and he was attorney general of North Carolina.  I’ve known him for almost two decades.  And he is an extraordinary leader. And I want to also thank the extraordinary leaders who are service members and their families who are here with us this afternoon.  Thank you all.  (Applause.) You know, one of my greatest honors as vice president is to meet with our service members around the world.  I have met with our service members from NATO’s eastern flank to the Korean DMZ, and from Arizona to Florida.  And I will tell you what everybody here knows: All our service members possess an extraordinary skill, discipline, dedication, and love of country.  (Applause.)  And I know their families serve with equal dedication, and I thank you also.  (Applause.) And I say everywhere I go around the world: We are so proud that the United States military is the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen.  (Applause.) Which is why President Biden and I are proud to have passed the PACT Act — (applause) — the largest expansion of health care and benefits for veterans and military families and survivors — the largest benefit in decades.  So, thank you, again, everyone here and, in particular, our military members and your families for the service and the dedication that you have shown. So, today, we are 110 days out from the election.  (Applause.)  And while many of us have been involved with these elections for every four years, practically, nearly every time we will say, “This is the one.”  Well, this here is the one — the most existential, consequential, and important election of our lifetime.  And there is so much at stake. Last night was the latest example.  So, some of you may have heard Donald Trump’s running mate deliver remarks at the Republican National Convention. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  He talked about his life story about growing up in southwest Ohio, and it was compelling.  It’s a compelling story.  And it was not the full story.  (Laughter.) Frankly, what is very telling is what he did not talk about on that stage.  He did not talk about Project 2025 — AUDIENCE:  No. THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — their 900-page blueprint for a second Trump term.  He did not talk about it because their plans are extreme and they are divisive. In recent days, they’ve been trying to portray themselves as the party of unity.  But here’s the thing — here’s the thing.  If you claim to stand for unity, you need to do more than just use the word.  (Applause.)  You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are pushing an agenda that deprives whole groups of Americans of basic freedoms, opportunity, and dignity.  (Applause.) You cannot claim you stand for unity if you are intent on taking reproductive freedoms from the people of America and the women of America — (applause) — trying to ban abortion nationwide, as they do, and restrict access to IVF and contraception, as their plan calls for. You cannot claim to be for unity if you try to overturn a free and fair election — (applause) — and threaten — and threaten to terminate the United States Constitution.  (Applause.) And you cannot claim to be for unity when your entire economic agenda is designed to prioritize billionaires and big corporations over the middle class.  (Applause.) We’re too busy watching what you’re doing to hear what you’re saying. And let us unpack that last point about the economy.  This race can be boiled down to a single question: Who fights for you?  Now we know whose side our president, Joe Biden, is on.  (Applause.) He grew up in a middle-class family in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and he has never forgotten where he came from.  With — and I have been a firsthand witness.  With every decision he makes in the Oval Office, he thinks about how it will impact working Americans.  He understands.  (Applause.)  He understands everyday struggles because he has actually lived them. So, friends, I say the contrast between Joe Biden and Donald Trump is like night and day.  But with the selection of his running mate this week, Donald Trump is also trying to distract people.  He wants to direct attention away from his record and his Project 2025 plan to suggest that he and his running mate are going to prioritize the middle class.  But we are not buying it.  (Applause.)  We are not falling for the okeydoke. As many of you know, I am a former prosecutor.  So, I say let’s look at the facts, shall we?  (Applause.)  (Laughs.) So, Donald Trump tries to claim he brought back American manufacturing.  The fact is, under Donald Trump, America lost tens of thousands of manufacturing jobs, and more than 1,000 factories closed under his watch.  The facts. Meanwhile, President Joe Biden and I have created nearly 800,000 new manufacturing jobs — (applause) — so much so, it’s been described as a “manufacturing boom.” Last night, we heard claims that Donald Trump is for fighting for our seniors.  Well, how the heck can you claim you fight for seniors when you intend to cut Social Security and Medicare — (applause) — which we all know is a lifeline for so many of our seniors? Let me be very clear: President Joe Biden and I will always protect Social Security and we will always protect Medicare — (applause) — all while we continue to fight to lower the cost of s- — prescription drugs for our seniors.  (Applause.)  It is President Biden and I that took on Big Pharma and finally capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month.  (Applause.) Who here has a family member with diabetes to know what that means?  (Applause.)  Right. But Donald Trump and his running mate intend to get rid of our $35 cap on insulin.  They will side with Big Pharma and let them make prescription drugs more expensive. Not only that, on the issue of health care, they intend to get rid of the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Donald Trump and his allies tried more than 60 times to end the Affordable Care Act — 60 times — to give insurance companies back the power to deny people with preexisting conditions.  You all remember what that was like? AUDIENCE:  Yeah! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Children with asthma, women who had survived breast cancer, grandparents with diabetes. President Biden and I, on the other hand, have made the Affordable Care Act more strong — (applause) — because, you see, we believe health care should be a right and not just a privilege of those who can afford it.  (Applause.) Pull up the split screen.  Whereas the last administration gave tax cuts to billionaires — AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we gave tax cuts to families through the Child Tax Credit, which cut child poverty in America by half.  (Applause.) And please do note: Their Project 2025 agenda would even end Head Start — AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — to take away preschool from hundreds of thousands of our children. On the issue of the cost of living, Donald Trump says he will implement a 10 percent tariff on all imported goods.  Well, understand: Independent economists agree his tariffs would increase the cost of everyday expenses for families — the cost of gas, groceries, and clothing. We, on the other hand, have taken on Big Pharma, the big banks, and big corporations to bring down costs.  (Applause.) It is we who have canceled debt, including student loan debt.  In fact — (applause).  Testify if you have received it.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  Indeed. In fact, so far, we have forgiven student loan debt for nearly 5 million Americans — (applause) — and twice as much for our public servants, including our teachers, our nurses, and our firefighters.  (Applause.) AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You’re welcome.  (Laughter.) We are also fighting to lower energy costs.  (Applause.)  We made historic investments in clean energy.  Today, America has record energy production and we are energy independent.  (Applause.)  But Trump wants to roll back our progress. Check this out: In fundraisers with Big Oil lobbyists, he wanted to trade clean energy investments that we made for you for a $1 billion campaign contribution he could get for himself. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Understand motivation. So, North Carolina, I think it is clear: If Donald Tremp — Donald Trump were to win in November, he will continue to sell out working families, he will continue to attack reproductive freedom, and he will continue to undermine our democracy. Ultimately, in this election, we each face a question.  And this herein lies our power.  The question we face is: What kind of country do we want to live in? Do we want to live in a country of freedom — AUDIENCE:  Yes!  (Applause.) THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — compassion — AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and rule of law? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Or a country of chaos — AUDIENCE:  No! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — fear — AUDIENCE:  No! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and hate? AUDIENCE:  No! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We each have the power to answer this question. So, today, then, I ask, North Carolina: Are you ready to make your voices heard?  (Applause.) Do we believe in freedom?  (Applause.) AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  DO we believe in the promise of America? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And are we ready to fight for it? AUDIENCE:  Yes! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And when we fight — AUDIENCE:  We win! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we win. God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.) God bless you.  (Applause.) END                 2:27 P.M.

Many people Trump knows quite well are behind it. Six of his former Cabinet secretaries helped write or collaborated on the 900-page playbook for a second Trump term published by the Heritage Foundation. Four individuals Trump nominated as ambassadors were also involved, along with several enforcers of his controversial immigration crackdown. And about 20 pages are credited to his first deputy chief of staff. In fact, at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership,” the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch. Dozens more who staffed Trump’s government hold positions with conservative groups advising Project 2025, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and longtime adviser Stephen Miller. These groups also include several lawyers deeply involved in Trump’s attempts to remain in power, such as his impeachment attorney Jay Sekulow and two of the legal architects of his failed bid to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Cleta Mitchell and John Eastman. To quantify the scope of the involvement from Trump’s orbit, CNN reviewed online biographies, LinkedIn profiles and news clippings for more than 1,000 people listed on published directories for the 110 organizations on Project 2025’s advisory board, as well as the 200-plus names credited with working on “Mandate for Leadership.” Overall, CNN found nearly 240 people with ties to both Project 2025 and to Trump, covering nearly every aspect of his time in politics and the White House – from day-to-day foot soldiers in Washington to the highest levels of his government. The number is likely higher because many individuals’ online résumés were not available. In addition to people who worked directly for Trump, others who participated in Project 2025 were appointed by the former president to independent positions. For instance, Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr authored an entire chapter of proposed changes to his agency, and Lisa Correnti, an anti-abortion advocate Trump appointed as a delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, is among the contributors. Several people involved in Project 2025 didn’t serve in the Trump administration but were influential in shaping his first term. One example is former US Attorney Brett Tolman, a leading force behind the former president’s criminal justice reform law who laterhelped arrange a pardon for Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law. Tolman is listed as a contributor to “Mandate for Leadership.” The extensive overlap between Project 2025 and Trump’s universe of allies, advisers and former staff complicates his efforts to distance himself from the work. Trump’s campaign has sought for months to make clear that Project 2025 doesn’t speak for them amid an intensifying push by President Joe Biden and Democrats to tie the Republican standard bearer to the playbook’s more controversial policies. In a statement to CNN, campaign spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez said Trump only endorses the Republican Party platform and the agenda posted on the former president’s website. “Team Biden and the (Democratic National Committee) are lying and fear-mongering because they have nothing else to offer the American people,” Alvarez said. Behind Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation, a 51-year-old conservative organization that aligned itself with Trump not long after his 2016 victory. Heritage is led by Kevin Roberts, a Trump ally whom the former president praised as “doing an unbelievable job” on a February night when they shared the same stage. Heritage conceived Project 2025 to begin planning so a Republican president could hit the ground running after the election. One of its priorities is creating a roadmap for the first 180 days of the new administration to quickly reorient every federal agency around its conservative vision. Described on its website as “a movement-wide effort guided by the conservative cause to address and reform the failings of big government and an undemocratic administrative state,” Project 2025 also aims to recruit and train thousands of people loyal to the conservative movement to fill federal government positions. One organization advising Project 2025, American Accountability Foundation, is also putting together a roster of current federal workers it suspects could impede Trump’s plans for a second term. Heritage ispaying the group $100,000 for its work. Many of Project 2025’s priorities are aligned with the former president, especially on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracies. Both Trump and Project 2025 have called for eliminating the Department of Education. But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn’t explicitly backed. Within “Mandate for Leadership” are plans toban pornography,reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, exclude the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, make it harder for transgender adults to transition, and eliminate the federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service. Its voluminous and detailed plans also run counter to Trump’s desire fora streamlined GOP platformabsent any language that Democrats could wield against Republicans this cycle. Roberts recently faced backlash as well for saying in an interview that the country was “in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.” Three days later, Trump posted to Truth Social: “I know nothing about Project 2025.” “I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,” he wrote. In response to Trump’s social media post, a Project 2025 spokesperson told CNN in a statement it “does not speak for any candidate or campaign.” “It is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to use,” the spokesperson said. Trump’s campaign has repeatedly said in recent months that “reports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical” and don’t represent the former president’s plans. Project 2025 and similar policy proposals coming from outside Trump’s campaign are “merely suggestions,” campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in a statement. However, Trump’s attempts to distance himself from Project 2025 have already encountered credibility challenges. The person overseeing Project 2025, Paul Dans, was a top official in Trump’s White House who has previously said he hopes to work for his former boss again. Shortly after Trump’s Truth Social post last week, Democrats noted a recruitment video for Project 2025 features a Trump campaign spokeswoman. On Tuesday, the Biden campaign posted dozens of examples of connections between Trump and Project 2025. CNN’s review of Project 2025’s contributors also demonstrated the breadth of Trump’s reach through the upper ranks of the vast network of organizations working to move the country in a conservative direction – from women’s groups and Christian colleges to conservative think tanks in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi. New organizations centered around Trump’s political movement, his conspiracy theories around his electoral defeats and his first-term policies are deeply involved in Project 2025 as well. One of the advisory groups, America First Legal, was started by Miller, a key player in forming Trump’s immigration agenda. Another is the Center for Renewing America, founded by Russ Vought, former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote for Project 2025 a detailed blueprint for consolidating executive power. Vought recently oversaw the Republican Party committee that drafted the new platform heavily influenced by Trump. In addition to Vought, two other former Trump Cabinet secretaries wrote chapters for “Mandate for Leadership”: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Three more former department heads – National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe, acting Transportation Secretary Steven Bradbury and acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella – are listed as contributors. Project 2025’s proposals for reforming the country’s immigration laws appear heavily influenced by those who helped execute Trump’s early enforcement measures. Former acting US Customs and Border Protection chiefMark Morganand former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chiefTom Homan– the faces of Trump’s polarizing policies – contributed to the project, as did Kathy Nuebel Kovarik,one of the policy advisers pushing to end certain immigrant protections behind the scenes. The Project 2025 chapter on overhauling the Department of Homeland Security was written by Ken Cuccinelli, a top official at the department under Trump. Some of Trump’s most contentious and high-profile hires are credited with working on “Mandate for Leadership,” including some whose tenures ended under a cloud of controversy. Before Trump adviser Peter Navarro went to prison for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena as part of the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, he wrote a section defending the former president’s trade policies and advocating for punitive tariffs. Other contributors include: Michael Pack, a conservative filmmaker who orchestrated a mass firing at the US Agency for Global Media after he was installed by Trump; Frank Wuco, a senior White House adviser who oncepromoted far-right conspiracieson his talk radio show, including lies about President Barack Obama’s citizenship; former NOAA official David Legates, a notable climate change skepticinvestigated for posting dubious research with the White House imprint; and Mari Stull, a wine blogger-turned-lobbyist who left the Trump administrationamid accusations she was hunting for disloyal State Department employees. The culmination of their work, spread across 900 pages, touches every corner of the executive branch and would drastically change the federal government as well as everyday life for many Americans. In summarizing the undertaking, Roberts wrote in “Mandate for Leadership” that Project 2025 represented “the next conservative President’s last opportunity to save our republic.” “Conservatives have just two years and one shot to get this right,” Roberts said. “With enemies at home and abroad, there is no margin for error. Time is running short. If we fail, the fight for the very idea of America may be lost.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:Section 1.  Policy.  High-quality early care and education and long-term care are critical to our Nation’s economic growth and economic security.  Early care and education give young children a strong start in life, while long-term care helps older Americans and people with disabilities live, work, and participate in their communities with dignity.  Access to both types of care is also critical to our national security because it helps ensure the recruitment, readiness, and retention of our military service members.Throughout this order, early care and education are collectively referred to as “child care.”  References to “care” that do not specify the type of care refer to both child care and long-term care.  References to the “care workforce” refer to individuals and businesses working in the fields of child care and long-term care.A sizeable majority of families and individuals in the United States who require care cannot access the affordable, high-quality care they need.  The markets for child care and long-term care for persons with disabilities and older adults who need support in their homes and communities fail to deliver enough high-quality care because of a persistent gap between the costs of providing this care and the prices families can pay.  High-quality care is labor intensive and requires skilled workers, and providers have limited ability to reduce costs.  As a result, even when high-quality care is available, it costs far more than many families and individuals can afford, causing them to forgo care altogether, seek lower-quality care options, juggle unconventional shifts at work, reduce their own paid work hours, drop out of the labor force, or make other arrangements.  Care expenditures represent a significant and increasing share of families’ budgets, with child care prices growing by approximately 26 percent and some types of long-term care costs growing by over 40 percent in the last decade.  Inadequate supply is exacerbated by high turnover in the care workforce.  Care workers — disproportionately women of color — are among the lowest-paid in the country and often have to rely on public benefits despite working complex and demanding jobs.  Investments in the care workforce are foundational to helping to retain care workers and improving health and educational outcomes.  In recent years, more than half of the long-term care workforce and nearly 20 percent of the child care workforce turned over each year.  And the workforce remains 8 percent smaller than before the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2019, more than three in four United States households that searched for care reported difficulty finding adequate care for their young children, and roughly the same share of center-based child care providers turned families away because they lacked enough child care slots.  Similarly, more than three in four long-term care service providers have reported not being able to accept new clients, making it harder for older Americans and people with disabilities to find the care they need.  Military families consistently cite access to high-quality child care as an impediment to military spouse employment and family economic security.  Difficulty accessing care also poses a challenge for both spouses — and, as data shows, particularly for women in dual military couples — to continuing their service if they have caregiving responsibilities.  The need for long-term care is likely to become more acute as our Nation’s population ages.  By 2060, there will be approximately twice as many adults over the age of 65 than in 2016, and projections indicate that there will be around 8 million long-term care job openings over the next decade.Family caregivers provide informal, often unpaid, care to help loved ones live in their homes and communities, including caring for aging family members, people with disabilities, and children.  At least 53 million people are family caregivers in the United States — including 5.5 million who are caring for wounded, ill, and injured service members and veterans — and many face challenges due to lack of support, training, and opportunities for rest.  Family caregivers include spouses, parents, siblings, adult and minor children, grandparents, and other relatives.  Family caregivers reflect the diversity of America’s communities, and people can assume family caregiving responsibilities at any stage of life.  Without adequate resources, family caregiving can affect caregivers’ own physical and emotional health and well-being and contribute to financial strain.  These negative consequences are felt most acutely by women, who make up nearly two-thirds of family caregivers and drop out of the workforce at a rate three times higher than men.It is the policy of my Administration to enable families — including our military and veteran families — to have access to affordable, high-quality care and to have support and resources as caregivers themselves.  It is also the policy of my Administration to ensure that the care workforce is supported, valued, and paid well.  Additionally, care workers should have the free and fair choice to join a union.The Congress must provide the transformative investments necessary to increase access to high-quality child care — including preschool and Head Start — and long-term care services, as well as high-quality, well-paying jobs that reflect the value the care workforce provides to families and communities.  Such investments include removing barriers and providing the funding needed for Tribal Nations to effectively provide high-quality child care and long-term care.Nearly every other advanced country makes greater public investments in care than the United States.  Investing in care is an investment in the future of America’s families, workforce, and economy.While the Congress must make significant new investments to give families in this country more breathing room when it comes to care, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must do what they can within their existing authorities to boost the supply of high-quality early care and education and long-term care and to provide support for family caregivers.  Through this order, I direct agencies to make all efforts to improve jobs and support for caregivers, increase access to affordable care for families, and provide more care options for families.Sec. 2.  Increasing Compensation and Improving Job Quality for Family Caregivers, Early Educators, and Long-Term Care Workers.  (a)  To increase compensation and benefits for early childhood educators and long-term care professionals who are providing federally funded services:(i)    the Secretary of Health and Human Services, through the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), shall issue guidance to States on ways to use enhanced funding to better connect home-

appropriate;(v)    the Department of the Treasury shall conduct outreach on the Saver’s Match credit, and the Department of Commerce shall conduct — and the Small Business Administration is encouraged to consider conducting — outreach on potential Federal resources available to assist small businesses in offering retirement plans, including a per-employee credit of up to $1,000, as provided in the SECURE 2.0 Act of 2022 (Division T of Public Law 117-328), in order to ensure that the care workforce, including individuals and small businesses, are aware of Federal retirement assistance for which they may be eligible.(b)  To improve working conditions and job quality in federally assisted child care and long-term care programs, encourage providers to establish incentives to recruit and retain workers, help prevent burnout, make it as easy as possible for care workers to access behavioral health services, and thereby improve the care that individuals receive, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall:(i)    consider additional actions — such as providing guidance, technical assistance, and provider and resident education — and rulemaking on nursing home staffing transparency to promote adequate staffing at nursing homes, building on the Department of Health and Human Services’ efforts to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy at nursing homes;(ii)   consider additional actions to reduce nursing staff turnover in nursing facilities and improve retention of those staff, advancing the Department of Health and Human Services’ efforts to measure and adjust payments based on staff turnover; and(iii)  implement strategies to expand mental health support for the care workforce, including early childhood providers supported through the Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) and Head Start.(c)  To expand training pathways and professional learning opportunities to increase job quality, improve quality of care, and attract new entrants into the care workforce, the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall:(i)    encourage recipients of Federal financial assistance to expand opportunities for early childhood educators and long-term care professionals through community college programming, career and technical education, Registered Apprenticeship, pre-apprenticeships leading to Registered Apprenticeship, and other job training and professional development;(ii)   make available innovative funding opportunities, develop and evaluate demonstration projects for care training and educational attainment, and provide technical assistance to State, local, and Tribal partners to improve job quality for care occupations; and(iii)  develop partnerships with key stakeholders, including State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments; unions and labor organizations; State and local workforce development boards; institutions of higher education (including community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and Minority Serving Institutions); aging and disability networks; and national- and community-based organizations that focus on care (including professional membership organizations).(d)  To support family caregivers of beneficiaries of Federal health care programs and services, and in conjunction with implementing the 2022 National Strategy to Support Family Caregivers:(i)    the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, consistent with the criteria set out in section 1115A(b)(2) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1315a(b)(2)), consider whether to select for testing by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation an innovative new health care payment and service delivery model focused on dementia care that would include family caregiver supports such as respite care;(ii)   the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider how better to evaluate and clearly set expectations for family caregivers in the Acute Hospital Care at Home program, which allows hospitals to treat in their homes those who would otherwise be hospital inpatients;(iii)  the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take steps to ensure that hospitals are actively involving family caregivers in the discharge planning process, consistent with CMS condition of participation discharge planning requirements, including by promoting best practices such as partnerships with community-based organizations and using resources from the Administration for Community Living and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality;(iv)   the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall increase beneficiary communications and support family caregivers by increasing promotion of the option for Medicare beneficiaries to choose to give family caregivers access to their Medicare information via 1-800-MEDICARE and the State health insurance assistance program networks;(v)    the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking by the end of this fiscal year that would make any appropriate modifications to eligibility criteria for the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, which provides services and benefits, including a monthly stipend, for eligible caregivers of veterans who sustained a serious injury or illness in the line of duty; and(vi)   the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall develop and implement a pilot program to offer psychotherapy via video telehealth to family caregivers within the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers to improve their access to mental health services.(e)  To improve and expand opportunities through AmeriCorps to encourage more individuals to enter early learning careers, the Chief Executive Officer of AmeriCorps is encouraged to consider:(i)   expanding access to Segal AmeriCorps Education Awards, which AmeriCorps members can use to pay for education and training or reduce their student debt; providing loan forbearance for AmeriCorps members involved in early learning; and providing other benefits to supplement national service activities that support early learning; and(ii)  prioritizing applications that propose to implement or expand high-quality programs focused on early learning and prioritizing projects intended to prepare AmeriCorps members and AmeriCorps Seniors volunteers to enter early learning careers.(f)  To improve jobs of domestic child care and long-term care workers:(i)    the Secretary of Labor shall create and publish in multiple languages, as appropriate, compliance assistance and best practices materials — such as sample employment agreements for domestic child care and long-term care workers and their employers — to promote fair workplaces and ensure the parties know their rights and responsibilities, and shall identify other means to promote employers’ adoption of best practices;(ii)   the Secretary of Labor shall work with community and other local partners to expand culturally and linguistically appropriate community outreach and education efforts to domestic child care and long-term care workers in order to combat their exploitation; and(iii)  the Chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission is encouraged to work with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop materials addressing the employment rights of non-citizen domestic child care and long-term care workers who are legally eligible to work.(g)  To improve data and information on the care workforce:(i)    the Secretary of Labor shall conduct and publish an analysis of early childhood and home care workers’ pay in comparison to the pay of other workers with similar levels of training and skill;(ii)   the Secretary of Labor shall issue guidance to help States and localities conduct their own analyses of comparable pay rates for care workers in their respective jurisdictions; and(iii)  the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in consultation with relevant agencies and external experts and organizations, jointly conduct a review to identify gaps in knowledge about the home- and community-based workforce serving people with disabilities and older adults; identify and evaluate existing data sources; and identify opportunities to expand analyses, supplement data, or launch new efforts to provide important data on the home- and community-based care workforce and ensure equity for people with disabilities and older adults.  The Secretaries shall publicly release the findings and recommendations of this review no later than April 2024.Sec. 3.  Making Care More Accessible and Affordable for Families.  (a)  To increase access to affordable, high-quality child care and long-term care for workers delivering federally assisted projects:(i)    Agencies shall identify and issue guidance on which agency discretionary, formula, and program-specific funds can be used for child care and long-term care as a supportive service for workers who are being trained for and working on federally funded projects, and in doing so shall consider agency funds made available by the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58); Public Law 117-169, commonly referred to as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022; and division A of Public Law 117-167, known as the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) Act of 2022.(ii)   With respect to the agency funds identified in subsection (a)(i) of this section:(A)  Agencies shall consider requiring, where appropriate, applicants for Federal job-creation or workforce development funds to provide affordable, accessible, safe, and reliable child care and long-term care for workers carrying out federally assisted projects (including both construction and operating phases where applicable), or shall consider preferencing applicants that use the funds for this purpose or encouraging applicants to use funds for this purpose.  Agencies shall provide implementation guidance to relevant program staff and collaborate with the Department of Labor to identify potential support for these actions, including technical assistance for guidance and funding opportunities.(B)  Agencies shall consider providing technical assistance to help funding recipients provide access to child care and long-term care as a supportive service and to connect funding recipients with potential partners, including care associations, community-based organizations, Registered Apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs, and labor unions.(C)  In cases where child care or long-term care is required or encouraged, agencies shall consider collecting information from funding recipients on whether and how they will provide access to child care and long-term care, and how many workers (including apprentices and pre-apprentices) would be affected.(iii)  The Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, shall support the efforts outlined in subsection (a) of this section by issuing guidance and providing technical assistance with best practices and models for how to provide supportive services, including child care and long-term care.(b)  To lower child care costs for families eligible for Federal programs, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall:(i)    consider issuing regulations to pursue policies to reduce child care costs for families benefiting from CCDF;(ii)   identify potential opportunities to reduce barriers to eligibility for Head Start and CCDF;(iii)  encourage States, through all available avenues, to increase the use of Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds for basic assistance and work supports for families — including access to child care — and to spend more funds on cash assistance for families; and(iv)   identify other potential strategies to make child care and Head Start more accessible for those families most in need.(c)  To help more Federal employees access affordable care:(i)    the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall consider establishing criteria that support equitable and accessible employee participation in child care programs, to include agencies’ adoption of income thresholds that are aligned with increasing costs of child care;(ii)   the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall conduct a review of child care subsidy policy and agency program data to determine the effectiveness of current child care subsidies within the Federal Government;(iii)  the heads of agencies are encouraged to expand employee access to child care services through Federal child care centers, child care subsidies, or contracted care providers; and(iv)   the Department of Defense shall take steps to enhance recruitment and retention of the Department’s child development program workers and to improve the affordability of child care for service members by September 2023, in addition to its ongoing efforts as part of the Fourteenth Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation to assess how child care costs impact the ability of the military to attract and retain its workforce.Sec. 4.  Expanding Options for Families by Building the Supply of Care.  (a)  To provide families with more options for high-quality long-term, home-, and community-based care and early learning services:(i)    The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consider rulemaking to improve access to home- and community-based services under Medicaid.  As part of any such rulemaking, the Secretary shall consider taking steps to support provider participation in Medicaid home- and community-based programs.(ii)   The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall issue policies that would support child care providers to give families more options to access high-quality child care providers, and shall update payment practices to improve provider stability and supply.(iii)  The Secretary of Education shall update a guide for schools and districts to expand high-quality early learning programming using Federal funds so that more preschoolers are fully prepared to succeed in school.(iv)   The Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall identify and disseminate evidence-based practices for serving children with disabilities and their families in high-quality early childhood education programs, including Head Start.  The Secretaries shall also take steps to ensure that services are inclusive of children with disabilities and their families; highlight any resources that are available to aid in that effort, including for preschool-aged children with disabilities under section 619 of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and for infants and toddlers with disabilities and their families under Part C of the IDEA; and provide information to support all early childhood programs in meeting their obligations under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.(v)    The Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is encouraged to consider developing financial guidance resources that support families during their care planning.(vi)   The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take steps to streamline processes for Tribes to use CCDF and Head Start funding to construct and improve facilities, including facilities that are jointly funded.(vii)  The 12 agencies that signed the October 2022 Memorandum of Agreement to implement Public Law 102-477 (the “Tribal 477 Program”) shall increase the effectiveness of Tribal employment and training programs to ensure child care can be used as a support for families by reducing and streamlining administrative requirements, including through consolidation of budgeting, reporting, and auditing systems.(b)  To expand options for quality home- and community-based services to veterans:(i)    The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider expanding the existing Veteran Directed Care Program — which provides veterans who need help with daily living with a budget to spend on home- and community-based services including personal care services — to all Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Centers by the end of Fiscal Year 2024, and shall consider developing an implementation plan for this expansion by June 2023.(ii)   The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider designing and evaluating a pilot program in no fewer than five veteran sites or in five States for a new Co-Employer Option for delivering veteran home health services.  Features of the program may include allowing veterans to choose who provides their care and to determine when and how that care is delivered, and connecting veterans with a third-party agency that would help coordinate administrative tasks and act as an intermediary between veterans and their home health workers.  Should the Department of Veterans Affairs implement this pilot program, it shall provide an implementation plan — including cost estimates and evaluation strategy — to the President, through the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, before August 31, 2023.(iii)  The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consider expanding the Home-Based Primary Care program by adding 75 new interdisciplinary teams to provide care to veterans in their homes.(c)  To increase the supply of providers and options for families by encouraging greater private financial protection, support, and technical assistance for care providers:(i)    the Secretary of the Treasury shall consider providing information to and sharing industry best practices with Community Development Financial Institutions to facilitate capital flows and support to care providers;(ii)   the Administrator of the Small Business Administration is encouraged to consider publishing a guide on how individuals in the care workforce may start and sustainably operate care businesses locally and through Small Business Administration programming; and(iii)  the Director of the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is encouraged to consider issuing guidance addressing financial institution practices that may increase the burden on the care workforce, discourage their work, and harm their financial well-being.(d)  To build the capacity of local communities to better coordinate and deliver care:(i)   the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall review existing policies to identify opportunities — including among Tribal communities — to increase the capacity of community care entities by providing operational support to these networks of providers; and(ii)  the Secretary of Agriculture shall use the Rural Partners Network and issue guidance developed in partnership with the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promote opportunities — including by hosting workshops — to increase access to child care and long-term care in rural and Tribal communities.(e)  To make the delivery and design of Federal care assistance and programs work better for families, the care workforce, and people seeking care, the Secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Agriculture, Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Veterans Affairs shall consider — and the Administrator of the Small Business Administration is encouraged to consider — prioritizing engagement with parents, guardians, and other relatives with care responsibilities; individuals receiving long-term care; State and local care experts; care providers and workers; employers; and labor unions.Sec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:(i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or(ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.(b)  This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.(c)  Where not already specified, independent agencies are encouraged to comply with the requirements of this order.(d)  This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.

More than 91% of households earning from $50,000 to $100,000 a year — the category that includes most teachers, firefighters and nurses — paid effective tax rates of 15% or less, often much less.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 By Greg Leiserson, Senior Economist (CEA); and Danny Yagan, Chief Economist (OMB) Abstract: We estimate the average Federal individual income tax rate paid by America’s 400 wealthiest families, using a relatively comprehensive measure of their income that includes income from unsold stock. We do so using publicly available statistics from the IRS Statistics of Income Division, the Survey of Consumer Finances, and Forbes magazine. In our primary analysis, we estimate an average Federal individual income tax rate of 8.2 percent for the period 2010-2018. We also present sensitivity analyses that yield estimates in the 6-12 percent range. The President’s proposals mitigate two key contributors to the low estimated rate: preferential tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, and wealthy families’ ability to avoid paying income tax on capital gains through a provision known as stepped-up basis. When an American earns a dollar of wages, that dollar is taxed immediately at ordinary income tax rates.[1]But when they gain a dollar because their stocks increase in value, that dollar is taxed at a low preferred rate, or never at all.[2]Investment gains are a primary source of income for the wealthy, making this preferential treatment of investment gains a valuable benefit for the wealthiest Americans. Yet the most common estimates of tax rates do not fully capture the value of this tax benefit because they use an incomplete measure of income. This analysis asks: what was the average Federal individual income tax rate paid by the 400 wealthiest American families’ in recent years, determined using a more comprehensive measure of income? How the wealthy enjoy low income tax: preferred rates on an incomplete measure of income The wealthy pay low income tax rates, year after year, for two primary reasons. First, much of their income is taxed at preferred rates. In particular, income from dividends and from stock sales is taxed at a maximum of 20 percent (23.8 percent including the net investment income tax), which is much lower than the maximum 37 percent (40.8 percent) ordinary rate that applies to other income. Second, the wealthy can choose when their capital gains income appears on their income tax returns and even prevent it from ever appearing. If a wealthy investor never sells stock that has increased in value, those investment gains are wiped out for income tax purposes when those assets are passed on to their heirs under a provision known as stepped-up basis. Analyzing a more comprehensive measure of income Preferred tax rates on income from stock sales (“realized capital gains income”) and from dividends feature prominently in commonly cited tax rates as well as in our analysis. An important feature of our analysis that is less common in existing estimates of tax rates is that we include untaxed (“unrealized”) capital gains income in our more comprehensive income measure as they accrue.[3] Measuring income in this more comprehensive manner matters relatively little for estimating most families’ tax rates, as most families have few investment assets.[4]However, it matters greatly for the wealthiest families for whom such unrealized and thus untaxed gains are a large share of their income. Like all other forms of income, unrealized capital gains income can be tapped to finance consumption and can improve financial wellbeing. A common reference point for defining income in economics is known as Haig-Simons income.[5]Pre-tax Haig-Simons income equals families’ change in wealth, plus taxes and consumption. We define our income measure as families’ change in wealth plus easily estimable taxes. Our definition of income is more limited than the Haig-Simons definition because it excludes consumption and other taxes, but it is a simpler way to include a substantial share of capital gains in income and can be implemented with publicly available data.[6] Primary estimate and sensitivity In our primary analysis, we estimate that the 400 wealthiest families paid an average Federal individual income tax rate of 8.2 percent on $1.8 trillion of income over the period 2010–2018, the years from the last decade for which the necessary data are available. Two factors that contribute to this low estimated tax rate include low tax rates on the capital gains and dividends that are taxed, and wealthy families’ ability to permanently avoid paying tax on investment gains that are excluded from taxable income. The 2022 President’s Budget proposes to raise the capital gains and dividend tax rate and to virtually end stepped-up basis for the highest-income Americans, thereby ensuring these investment gains are subject to income tax. The true tax rate of interest may differ from our primary estimate. First, excluding consumption and some taxes from our measure of income suggests that the 8.2 percent estimate is actually higher than the tax rate measured relative to a truly comprehensive measure of income. Second, the data and methods on which we rely are imperfect. Different estimation choices illustrate the estimate’s sensitivity. For example, varying the analytic assumptions underlying one of our key methodological choices (discussed in greater detail in the technical appendix below) causes the estimate to vary from 6 to 12 percent. The tax rate we estimate is, of course, sensitive to changes in policy. The top capital gains tax rate was 15 percent between May 2003 and 2012 and has been 20 percent (23.8 percent including the net investment income tax) since 2013. In addition, the Federal individual income tax is only one tax. Focusing on the individual income tax sheds light on the structural limitations of that tax and the scope for reforms, such as curtailing the ability of the wealthy to avoid paying tax on their investment gains through stepped-up basis. However, alternative tax rates could also be estimated that account for other taxes, such as the payroll tax, estate and gift tax, corporate income tax, and taxes paid to foreign governments. Moreover, one could use alternative definitions of income or adopt various approaches to the treatment of certain subsidized activities such as charitable giving. Finally, we focus on an extended time period (2010–2018), which helps to ensure that our analysis reflects the long-run reality of positive asset incomes despite short-run fluctuations. However, we also present alternative estimates using different start and end years, as well as an estimate that replaces the Forbes 400 wealth in 2009 with the average for the period 2008–2010. Our primary estimate of 8.2 percent is much lower than commonly cited estimates of top Federal individual income tax rates. For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation (2021) estimates that the 2021 Federal individual income tax rate on the top 0.4 percent of families ranked by income (i.e., the 715,000 families with income over $1 million) will be 26 percent. Our analysis differs by (a) analyzing a smaller group of families (the top 0.0002 percent) ranked by wealth, and (b) including unrealized capital gains income in the income measure. See the end of the technical appendix for additional discussion of how our analysis compares to commonly cited estimates. Method We emphasize that any estimate of tax rates on the wealthiest is uncertain and open to refinement, due to current data limitations. We detail our method in the technical appendix below. In a nutshell, our method is as follows: we take the IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) Division’s Federal individual income taxes paid by the top-400-by-incomefamilies and multiply it by an adjustment factor constructed using the Survey of Consumer Finances (0.63) to convert it to an estimate of taxes paid by the top-400-by-wealth. We then estimate a more comprehensive measure of income as the change in Forbes 400 wealth, plus our estimates of the top-400-by-wealth’s Federal individual income taxes paid and State-and-local tax deductions (estimated similarly based on Statistics of Income data). The ratio of the two yields our estimated tax rate. Conclusion In this analysis, we used publicly available data to estimate the average Federal individual income tax rate paid by America’s wealthiest 400 families, using a relatively comprehensive measure of their income that includes income from unsold stock. In our primary analysis, we estimated an average tax rate of 8.2 percent for the period 2010–2018. We also present sensitivity analyses that yield estimates in the 6–12 percent range. Preferential capital gains rates and stepped-up basis—a provision of tax law that allows wealthy taxpayers to wipe out unrealized capital gains for income tax purposes when they pass assets to their heirs—contribute to this low tax rate. The 2022 President’s Budget would increase capital gains rates and virtually end stepped-up basis for the highest-income Americans, thereby ensuring their investment gains are subject to income tax. Technical Appendix This technical appendix documents how we combine publicly available data from the IRS Statistics of Income (SOI) Division, the Federal Reserve Board’s Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), and Forbes magazine’s estimates of the wealthiest 400 Americans to estimate the Federal individual income tax rate paid by the wealthiest 400 families. For reference, Forbes estimates that the 400 wealthiest Americans in 2018 had wealth ranging from $2.1 billion to $160 billion. Our tax rate estimate is dollar-weighted: it is an estimate of total Federal individual income taxes paid by the wealthiest families, divided by an estimate of those families’ income. We focus on the period 2010–2018 and report estimates for alternative periods as well. We first describe the basic idea of the estimation procedure and then go through the details. We divide an estimate of the Federal individual income taxes paid by the 400 wealthiest families by a relatively comprehensive estimate of their income. For the numerator, we start by estimating the taxes paid by the families with the highest reported income on tax returns. Then we estimate how the income of the highest-wealthfamilies compares to the income of the highest-reported-incomefamilies and use that as an adjustment factor to estimate the taxes paid by the highest-wealth families. For the denominator, we use changes in the reported wealth of the Forbes 400 to estimate the income of the 400 wealthiest families. Numerator: estimated Federal individual income taxes paid by the wealthiest 400 families The numerator of our tax rate estimate equals estimated 2010–2018 taxes paid by the wealthiest 400 families. We construct the numerator by estimating the 2010–2018 taxes paid by the highest-reported-income families, then multiply by an adjustment factor based on the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) to account for the fact that highest-reported-income families are not the same as the highest-wealth families. SOI published estimates of the taxes paid by the 400 highest-reported-income families annually from 1992 through 2014. In a first and straightforward step, we extend this series through 2018. To do this, we rely on estimates of the total Federal individual income tax paid by the top 0.001 percent, available from SOI annually from 2001 through 2018. For the years 2001 through 2014, when both estimates are available, the ratio of taxes paid by the top 400 to taxes paid by the top 0.001 percent varies in only a small window around 0.59. We therefore estimate the taxes paid by the 400 highest-income families for the period 2015 through 2018 by assuming that it is 0.59 times the taxes paid by the top 0.001 percent for this period. Our SOI-based estimate of 2010–2018 taxes paid by the 400 highest-reported-income families equals actual SOI top-400 taxes for years 2010-2014, plus our estimates for years 2015–2018. Our SOI-based estimate of 2010–2018 taxes paid by the 400 highest-reported-income families surely exceeds the 2010–2018 taxes paid by the 400 highest-wealth families: some of the wealthiest families have lower reported income and pay less tax. For example, Warren Buffett was a member of the 2015 Forbes 400, but his voluntarily-released 2015 tax return information indicates 2015 adjusted gross income of $11.6 million (Cohen 2016). The thresholds for top percentile groups in 2015 in the SOI estimates show that $11.9 million was required to be in the top 0.01 percent (about 14,000 families). Thus, Buffett was not even in the top 14,000 tax units ranked by reported income, let alone the top 400 ranked by reported income. Moreover, he paid $1.8 million in Federal individual income tax in 2015, far less than the $36 million average for the top 0.001 percent or the $9 million average for the top 0.01 percent. As a result, the 2015 taxes paid by the top 400 families ranked by reported income would overstate the 2015 taxes paid by the top 400 families ranked by wealth. Hence, we must convert our SOI-based estimate of taxes paid by the highest-reported-income families into an estimate of taxes paid by the highest-wealth families. We do so by multiplying the SOI-based estimate by an adjustment factor of 0.63, constructed as follows from the Survey of Consumer Finances which contains information both on approximate reported income and on wealth. A formula helps to clarify the method. Our goal for the numerator of the tax rate is to estimate taxes paid by the families with wealth rank 1 through 400, which we write as: TAXW1,400. The SOI data give us an estimate of the taxes paid by the families with reported-income rank 1 through 400: TAXI1,400. Ideally, we would multiply TAXI1,400by an adjustment factor (in blue) equal to the ratio of the tax paid by the 400 highest-wealth families to the tax paid by the 400 highest-reported-income families: However, the ideal adjustment factor cannot be directly measured in publicly available data. The best available data source—the SCF—lacks information on taxes paid and excludes the Forbes 400 wealthiest from the survey sample by construction. We make two assumptions that allow one to approximate the ideal adjustment factor usingreported incomesamong familiesranked 401 through 1400(i.e., the “next-1,000” groups ranked either by reported income or by wealth), which is approximately the rest of the top 0.001 percent. First, we assume that the highest-reported-income and highest-wealth groups pay the same average tax rate.[7]Second, we assume that the ratio of the reported incomes for the next-1,000 groups is the same as the ratio of reported incomes for the top-400 groups. Under those assumptions, one can replace the ideal adjustment factor with the following alternative adjustment factor that uses only next-1000 information: Estimating the reported income of the next 1,000 by wealthIW401,1400is relatively straightforward: the SCF excludes the top 400 by wealth, so we simply use the reported income of the wealthiest families in the SCF.[8] Estimating the income of the next 1000 by incomeII401,1400is more challenging, as it depends on how much overlap there is between the Forbes 400 and the top 400 by reported income. If there is full overlap, then none of the top 400 by reported income should be in the SCF. We could then estimateII401,1400using the SCF observations with the highest reported incomes; doing so would yield an adjustment factor of 0.44, similar to Saez and Zucman (2019).[9]At the other extreme, if none of the Forbes 400 is in the top 1400 by income, then the appropriate SCF observations to use would be those with reported income ranks 401 through 1400. Doing so would exclude many high-reported-income families from the calculation and thereby yield a higher adjustment factor of 0.66.[10]A higher adjustment factor leads to a higher resulting tax rate estimate. We lean toward the conservative side of the spectrum: we assume an overlap of 100 and estimateII401,1400using the reported income of the SCF observations that represent families ranked 301 through 1300. Doing so, we obtain an adjustment factor of 0.63. Thus, our estimate of taxes paid by the wealthiest 400 families equals the SOI-based taxes paid by the 400 highest-reported-income families multiplied by our 0.63 adjustment factor. Denominator: estimated income We divide our estimate of taxes paid by the wealthiest 400 by our more comprehensive estimate of the wealthiest 400’s income: their estimated change in wealth, plus easily estimable taxes. This income measure excludes consumption and other taxes, which would cause us to understate Haig-Simons income and therefore overstate the Federal individual income tax rate on Haig-Simons income. To estimate comprehensive income for the 2010–2018 period, we begin by subtracting the total wealth (net worth) of the Forbes 400 in 2009 from the total wealth of the Forbes 400 in 2018.[11]We then add two additional components of Haig-Simons income that are available in tax data: Federal individual income taxes paid (estimated above) and State and local individual tax deductions (estimated from the same SOI data using the same 0.63 adjustment factor).[12] Estimate and sensitivity Using our estimated numerator and denominator, our primary estimate for the 2010–2018 Federal individual income tax rate for the wealthiest 400 is 8.2 percent. For the numerator, we estimate that the wealthiest 400 families paid $149 billion in Federal individual income taxes, equal to the $237 billion paid by the highest-income families in the SOI data multiplied by 0.63. For the denominator, Forbes estimates suggest that the wealthiest 400 experienced a change in wealth for the period 2010–2018 of $1.62 trillion. Adding the $149 billion of estimated Federal individual income taxes and an analogously estimated $46 billion in State and local taxes, we estimate the wealthiest 400’s income for the period 2010–2018 to be $1.82 trillion. Dividing $149 billion by $1.82 trillion, we obtain 8.2 percent. Appendix Table 1 presents a sensitivity analysis for different periods. Column 1 repeats our main analysis for time periods that begin in years other than 2010 (all ending in 2018). Our analysis for 2018 alone yields 8.5 percent, for the most recent five years yields 9.8 percent, and for the most recent 20 years yields 10.2 percent. Column 2 repeats the exercise for time periods that end in 2014, which is the last year that does not rely on extrapolated top-400 Federal individual income tax data (though it also includes fewer years with the higher post-2012 capital gains tax rates). Our analysis for years 2010–2014 yields 6.2 percent and for 2014 alone yields 6.3 percent. In addition, replacing 2009 Forbes 400 wealth with its 2008–2010 average yields an estimate of 8.6 percent. Our 0.63 adjustment factor is estimated with error. One of the most substantial risks to the accuracy of the estimate is if the income of the top 400 by wealth relative to the top 400 by income differs consistently from the corresponding ratio for the next 1000. Other uncertainties include sampling or non-sampling error in the SCF data on which we rely. Under the extreme assumption that the highest income families are the highest wealth families, the adjustment factor would equal 1, and the average tax rate for 2010-2018 would be 12.3 percent. If, on the other hand, the highest wealth families have only 43 percent of the income of the highest-income families following Saez and Zucman’s (2019) analysis, the average tax rate would be 5.8 percent. If the highest wealth families systematically differ from the next 1000 for whom information is available in the SCF, the ratio could, in principle, be even lower. We define our more comprehensive measure of income such that it is systematically lower than (pre-tax) Haig-Simons income, which includes all taxes and consumption. The SOI data contain information on one additional category of expenditure that could be included: deductible contributions to nonprofit organizations. When including these deductible contributions (estimated in the same way as we estimate State and local taxes) in comprehensive income, we obtain an estimate of 7.9 percent. Forbes 400 wealth is surely measured with error. An active literature studies and assesses wealth measurement at the very top of the wealth distribution (e.g., Kennickell 2009; Johnson, Raub, and Newcomb 2013; Piketty 2014; Kopczuk 2015). Saez and Zucman (2016) use capitalized income tax returns to, over some periods, estimate faster growth in top wealth than does the SCF while mostly taking Forbes as given. In ongoing work, Smith, Zidar, and Zwick (2020) do not publish top 400 estimates, but generally estimate slower growth in top wealth, which could be consistent with Forbes being misled, unable to value nontraded assets, or unable to observe gifts or debt. Higher growth in top wealth would lead to lower tax rates while lower growth in top wealth would lead to higher tax rates. For example, if the Forbes 400 overstates top wealth growth by one-third, our estimate would be 11.7 percent. Combining data across three cross-sectional data sources yields some inconsistency in time periods studied. Our target population is the wealthiest in each year of the period examined based on end-of-year wealth. The Forbes 400 data are released each fall. The 0.63 adjustment factor is based on families ranked by income in yeart, compared to families ranked by wealth when surveyed at some point in yeart+1(though the reported wealth may or may not be current as of the time they were surveyed). Since the wealthiest families change over time, subtracting Forbes 400 totals across years understates the income of the wealthiest at the end of each year, which leads to overestimated tax rates.[13] Our tax rate estimates are substantially lower than commonly cited top Federal individual income tax rates produced by the Congressional Budget Office, Joint Committee on Taxation, the Department of the Treasury, and the Tax Policy Center.[14]These estimates differ from ours in three key respects. First, and most fundamentally, the Congressional Budget Office, Joint Committee on Taxation, the Treasury, and the Tax Policy Center estimate tax rates relative to income measures that largely exclude unrealized capital gains. The analyses thus find substantially higher tax rates than we do because they, to varying degrees, exclude the untaxed income that motivates this analysis in favor of more accurately estimated cash income flows. Second, tax-preferred realized capital gains are a larger share of income for the top 400 than they are for the larger top groups for which these other estimates are produced. Third, we examine income tax rates by wealth rather than by income, and unrealized capital gains may be even more concentrated among high-wealth families than high-income families. We conclude this technical appendix by emphasizing the fundamental uncertainty in our estimates. We hope that our analysis stimulates further estimation and direct measurement of income tax rates inclusive of unrealized capital gains income and by wealth group. References Bricker, J., P.

Other generally applicable tax benefits may also reduce a worker’s tax rate. [2]The minority of capital gains, realized within one year of acquiring the underlying asset, is taxed at ordinary rates. [3]Unrealized capital gains are the increase in the value of assets even before the assets are sold. A wealthy individual who purchases corporate stock worth $100 million that subsequently increases in value to $200 million over the next ten years has accrued $100 million of unrealized capital gains income over that period. These unrealized capital gains are a major source of income for the wealthiest Americans. [4]For example, the Federal Reserve’s Distributional Financial Accounts estimate that, as of the first quarter of 2021, the top 1 percent of families by wealth held 54 percent of the value of corporate stocks and mutual funds, compared to 11 percent for 50th–90thpercentiles, and less than 1 percent for the bottom 50 percent. [5]For example, the Joint Committee on Taxation (2012) states, “Economists generally agree that, in theory, a Haig-Simons measure of income is the best measure of economic well-being.” [6]This approach would be less informative for middle-class families because they consume a much larger share of their income. [7]We lack direct evidence on the average tax rate paid by the highest-wealth families. In principle, the average tax rate could differ in either direction. The highest-income families could pay a lower average tax rate because they are high-income due to large single-year capital gains realizations that are taxed at low rates. Alternatively, the highest-wealth families could pay a lower share of their tax-return income in taxes due to large charitable deductions. [8]The Survey of Consumer Finances intentionally excludes from its sample anybody included in the Forbes 400 due to privacy concerns. However, some Forbes 400 wealth may be represented by families included in the Survey of Consumer Finances sample, and some additional observations are also excluded from the SCF sample. Bricker, Hansen, and Volz (2019) propose a method for augmenting the SCF with the Forbes 400 data without double counting. We simplify by assuming that there is a sharp cutoff between the two and do not rely on the Survey of Consumer Finances to compute any aggregates. [9]Note, however, that the assumption of full overlap would imply that the desired ratio for the top 400 would be one. In effect, under this set of assumptions, the value for the next 1000 would be a poor guide to the value for the top 400. In implementing the procedures described in this section, we use the 2001-2019 SCFs and average the resulting annual adjustment factors across years in order to increase our effective sample size. [10]Technically, because the SCF is a survey with sample weights, we mean the observations that, when weighted, represent these ranks. We split SCF observations that cross relevant rank boundaries, allocating a proportionate share of the observation’s weight to each side of the boundary. [11]The date for which the Forbes 400 estimates wealth has varied over time. In 2020, Forbes used market prices near the end of July. In 2019, Forbes used market prices in September. For simplicity, we treat the Forbes 400 as end-of-year wealth estimates. The Forbes list is a mix of person-level information and immediate-family information. By treating it as family-level (more precisely, tax-unit-level) information, our estimate of income could potentially be somewhat conservative, though we anticipate this effect is small. [12]We impute the State and local tax deductions for the top 400 for the period 2015–2018 as the top 400’s share of the top 0.001 percent’s State and local tax deductions in 2014 multiplied by the total deductions of the top 0.001 percent for 2015–2018. The 2017 tax law limited the State and local tax deduction. For 2018 only, we impute total State and local tax deductions of the top 0.001% tax units by multiplying 2018 top 0.001% Federal taxes by the ratio of total 2014-2017 State and local tax deductions to total 2014-2017 top 0.001% Federal taxes. [13]A further timing issue that could arise is if the wealthy systematically realize capital gains only when they are not in the top 400 by wealth. In this case, the tax rate of the top 400 by wealth in each year could understate a life-cycle estimate of the tax rate of the extremely wealthy. However, it is not clear that—if this is a concern—our estimate of the tax rate of the extremely wealthy is affected by it. If it were the case that the extremely wealthy systematically do not realize their income when they are in the top 400 by wealth, our adjustment factor may be an overestimate of their taxable income. [14]The Congressional Budget Office (2021) recently estimated that the average Federal individual income tax rate of the highest-income 1 percent of households was about 24 percent for the period 2014 through 2018. Other analysts focus primarily on forward-looking estimates. The Treasury Department (2020) estimated that the average Federal individual income tax rate of the highest-income 0.1 percent of families in 2021 would be 23 percent, and the Tax Policy Center (2021) estimated that it would be 25 percent. The Joint Committee on Taxation (2021) estimated that the tax rate for families with incomes of at least $1 million would be 26 percent. The 2017 Tax Act reduced individual income tax rates in 2018. However, this effect is small relative to the difference between the average Federal individual income tax rate on the wealthiest that we estimate and the estimates cited here.

                "title": "What Harris’ unrealized capital gains tax proposal means for you | CNN Politics",
                "text_body": "Atax proposalembraced by Vice President Kamala Harris that’s meant to target the wealthy is getting attention in an unlikely place for wonky policy debate: social media. But many posts ignore the fact that the plan would only impact those whose net worth is more than $100 million, or less than 1% of taxpayers, and falsely suggest that all homeowners should fear a new massive tax bill. One TikTok user, for example, claimed that people will “lose their homes” and that “the IRS will bankrupt them.” At issue is a proposal often referred to as a billionaire minimum tax.It would treat the increase in thevalue of assets – like real estate, stocks and private businesses – as taxable income each year, even if they are not sold. This is known as an unrealized capital gain. One way to think of it is asa tax on a gain, or profit, that exists only on paper. “It’s quite a transformational proposal,” said Mark Friedlich, vice president of government affairs at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting. On thecampaign trail, Harris has said she supports a billionaire minimum tax. She hasn’t outlined the specifics, but the Biden-Harris administration’s most recent budget proposal lays out details. A billionaire minimum tax is one of several proposals pushed by Democratsin recent years to tax the rich. Both President Joe Biden and Harris have consistently said that they want to make the “wealthiest Americans pay their fair share” and that the additional tax revenue raised could be used to pay for social spending programs, like helping families pay for child care or down-payment help for first-time homebuyers. Currently, some middle- and high-income people are subject to atax on realized capital gains, which results when an asset – like a stock or home – is sold for more than what the owner originally paid for it. Essentially, it’s a tax on the profit.Harris has specificallycalled for raising the top tax rate on millionaires with long-term realized capital gains from 20% to 28%. Here are key things to know about how these tax changes could work: A billionaire minimum tax on unrealized capital gains would apply to taxpayers whose net worth is above $100 million, as proposed by the most recent Biden-Harris administration’sbudget proposal. To help put that in context, just 20,209 taxpayers – or about 0.01% – had net worth valued at $50 million or more in 2019, according to the latest IRS data available. More recent data fromAltrata, a private firm, suggests the number of high-net worth individuals has grown over the past five years. But the share of all US taxpayers earning more than $100 million is still likely to be small. Harris’ proposal to increase the tax rate on realized capital gains to 28% would apply to taxpayers with income over $1 million. About 875,500 taxpayers – or 0.54% – reported having that much income in 2021, according to the IRS. Those who would be impacted are “the smallest slice of the very wealthy,” said Erica York, a senior economist and research director at the right-leaningTax Foundation. Let’s discuss how a billionaire minimum tax – which is, on a basic level, a tax on unrealized capital gains – would impact a homeowner. Currently, a homeowner pays a tax on the growth in the value of the home when it is sold, or realized. But a tax on unrealized capital gains would require a homeowner to pay a tax on the appreciated value of thehome each year – even if the house hasn’t been sold. For example, if a home was purchased for $500,000 and it appreciates in value to $520,000 the next year, the owner would owe some tax on the $20,000 increase. The tax would also apply to other kinds of assets like stocks and private businesses. But again, the Biden-Harris administration’sproposal would only impact those whose net worth is more than $100 million. Another misconception is about how much wealthy taxpayers would owe. It would not be a new, separate tax bill. Under the Biden-Harris administration’s proposal, impacted taxpayers would be required to pay a minimum effective tax rate of 25% on all of their income – including unrealized capital gains. If their effective tax rate on this recalculated income amount fell below 25%, they would owe additional taxes. To implement a tax on unrealized gains, the IRS would likely have to create a way to measure the change in value of a private business and real estate on an annual basis. The agency does not currently track these values. “This creates an enormous administrative burden on the IRS, as if it’s not already challenged enough,” Friedlich said. The new challenge could take away the agency’s core responsibilities of processing returns in a timely fashion and providing customer service help. There could be ways to alleviate the burden on the IRS, depending on the details of the proposal. For example,a 2021 proposalfrom Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, would not have taxed non-tradable assets like real estate or businesses annually. Even if Democrats control both the House and Senate during a potential Harris presidency, it may be hard to get the votes to pass the billionaire minimum tax or the increase to the long-term capital gains tax rate through Congress. In 2021, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and KyrstenSinema of Arizona – both former Democrats who have since turned independent –blocked similar tax measures from moving forward. If passed, a billionaire minimum tax – an unprecedented tax on income not yet received – would likelyface many legal challenges. Some critics of Democrats’ wealth tax proposals have suggested that people can’t trust that they would not eventually be expanded to middle-class households. If history is any indication, there are examples to show that the government has both expanded and narrowed taxes after first implementing them. The federal income tax, for example, has expanded to more people over time.The impact of the estate tax, on the other hand, has narrowed. Consistent with Biden’s policies, Harris has said nothing to suggest that she intends to raise taxes for people who earn less than $400,000 a year.﻿ Harris hasn’t talked specifically about this, but there’s a provision in Biden’s budget that would change the way inherited assets are taxed. Currently, you don’t have to pay a capital gains tax when you inherit a home, stocks or a business that have increased in value, thanks to a provision called “step-up in basis.” But the Biden proposal would make some wealthy people pay that tax when an appreciated asset is passed on after death. The argument is that the step-up in basis primarily benefits the rich, whose wealth is more often tied up in real estate and stocks. It currently allows some wealth to avoid ever being taxed as it’s passed down from one family member to another. Biden’s proposed change would only apply to inheritances where the appreciated value is worth more than $5 million for individuals or more than $10 million for married couples. Assets donated to charity would also be excluded from the tax. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 President Biden has long believed that we must build the economy from the bottom up and middle out, not the top down. As the President says, when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. He believes the best way to grow the economy, create good-paying jobs, and lower costs for families is by promoting workers, investing in America and its people, making the economy more competitive, and reforming the tax code to reward work and not wealth. Our progress over the last two years shows that his economic strategy is working.The state of the economy is strong. Tomorrow night, President Biden will highlight the historic progress we have made to bring the economy back from the pandemic and create more jobs in a two-year period than under any other president on record. He will discuss progress lowering costs and providing more breathing room for families, including cutting prescription drug costs, health insurance premiums, and energy bills, while driving the uninsured rate to historic lows. He will outline the manufacturing boom across the country—in infrastructure, semi-conductors, and clean energy—that is strengthening parts of the country left behind and creating good jobs, including for workers without college degrees.And, he will emphasize that his economic strategy has been a fiscally responsible one. President Biden’s predecessor passed anearly $2 trillionunpaid for tax cut with benefitsskewedto the wealthy and large corporations, and thedeficitwent up every single year under his watch. Under President Biden, the deficit hasfallenby $1.7 trillion, and his reforms to take on Big Pharma, lower prescription drug costs, and make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share will reduce the deficit byhundreds of billionsmore.President Biden knows that the work to build an economy from the bottom up and middle out is far from done. He will say that we need to build on this work to continue growing our economy and lowering costs. He will discuss the work to come to implement his historic investment agenda in a way that benefits all Americans. And, the President will preview the budget he will send to Congress on March 9, which will build on the historic economic progress of the past two years by continuing to invest in America and its people, continuing to lower costs for families—from child care to housing to college to health care—protecting and strengthening Social Security and Medicare, and reducing the deficit through additional reforms to ensure the wealthy and largest corporations pay their fair share.Historic Progress to Create Jobs, Promote Workers, and Transition to Steady and Stable Growth When President Biden took office, the economy was in crisis, millions were out of work, and Main Streets were shuttered. In two years, the President has overseen a historic economy recovery and laid the foundation for steady and stable growth in the years to come. A historic, equitable economic recovery.President Biden’s economic strategy led to a historic recovery with tangible benefits for workers and families. Since President Biden took office, the economy has created more than12 million jobs—including more than800,000manufacturing jobs—and the unemployment rate is at a 54-yearlow, including near record lows forBlackworkers. The unemployment rate forHispanicworkers hit a record low last year. The past two years were also the best two years for new small business applications onrecord. None of this progress was pre-ordained. Before President Biden signed his Rescue Plan into law,expertspredicted it would take far longer to create this many jobs. And few—if any—experts predicted it would be possible to get the unemployment rate down to a level last seen in 1969. In fact, before the Rescue Plan passed, the Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate in the first quarter of 2023 would be 4.8%, rather than its current level of 3.4%. More breathing room and economic security for families.This historic jobs recovery, along with Biden-Harris Administration policies designed to help workers and families, has left families more economically secure than before the pandemic. Compared to pre-pandemic levels, households are now less likely to be delinquent on theircredit card billsandmortgages, and more likely to havehealth insurance. They are facing fewerevictionsand foreclosures than there were before the pandemic, and bankruptcy rates are lower as well. This economic security is giving families peace of mind and breathing room that they didn’t have before the pandemic. Child poverty also fell to a historic low in 2021, and the President will call on Congress to continue these gains through the expanded Child Tax Credit, even as he has taken action to lift nearly 1 million children out of poverty by modernizing nutrition benefits. Progress on transitioning to steady, stable growth with lower inflation.In the wake of unprecedented economic disruption from a historic pandemic, inflation has been a challenge all over the globe. Last spring, President Biden set the goal of transitioning our economy to lower inflation, while maintaining a resilient job market for American workers. Now, annual inflation has fallen for six months straight, driven in large part by a roughly $1.50 decline in gas prices compared to last summer. Over the second half of 2022, three-month core inflation fell from nearly 8% at an annualized rate to 3% at an annualized rate—at the same time that the unemployment remained at or near 50-year lows. As a result of the progress on inflation and the resilience of the job market, wages adjusted for inflation are higher than they were seven months ago. While there is more work to do to bring inflation down and lower costs for families—and there may be setbacks along the way—the past six months have marked significant progress toward the President’s goal of bringing down inflation without giving up the economic progress we’ve made. Manufacturing Boom Across the Country and Historic Investments in Infrastructure Even before the pandemic, the middle class was hollowed out. Manufacturing jobs moved overseas and factories closed down. The President believes that the United States can lead the world in manufacturing again. His economic plan has done just that—generate a manufacturing boom across the country and build an economy where no one is left behind. The President’s economic plan is stimulating new factories and manufacturing lines and creating good-paying jobs that don’t require a four-year degree. His plan includes the most significant upgrade to our nation’s infrastructure in generations—an investment larger than FDR’s investment Rural Electrification and Eisenhower’s efforts to build the Interstate Highway system. It includes the most significant clean energy plan ever, transitioning the clean energy economy and lowering households’ energy costs. And, it includes the most substantial investment in science, innovation, and industrial strategy in over 50 years.In just the two years since President Biden took office, we have spurred more than $700 billion in announced private investment in manufacturing, utilities, and energy from more than 200 companies in all 50 states. Much of this investment is driven by the semiconductor, energy, electric vehicles and batteries, and other cutting-edge sectors.Ensuring President Biden’s agenda creates a future made in America.Building on the historic investment agenda the President has signed into law, President Biden is ensuring that our historic infrastructure investments use materials made in America. For decades, Buy America laws focused on iron and steel and only covered certain federally funded infrastructure projects. This giant loophole meant projects could be built with other materials sourced from anywhere in the world. The Biden-Harris Administration is working to close this loophole and implement new standards, once and for all, so materials for roads and bridges, airports, transit, rail, water, high-speed internet, and clean energy infrastructure are made in America and support American jobs.The President will announce in the State of the Union that he is issuing proposed guidance to ensure construction materials from copper and aluminum to fiber optic cable, lumber, and drywall, are made in America. Once finalized, these standards will apply to virtually all infrastructure spending supported by Federal financial assistance—not simply roads and bridges, but also buildings, water infrastructure and high-speed internet, providing consistency for companies and state and local governments to apply the standards and a strong federal government-wide demand signal.These steps complement the Administration’s implementation of the most robust updates in nearly 70 years to the Buy American Act for federal procurement. Those updates are helping to ensure that taxpayers’ dollars support American manufacturing, boost resiliency in critical industries, and create good-paying jobs right here at home. The Buy American rule increased the percentage value of component parts manufactured in the US from 55% to 60% this past fall as the first step toward increasing that value to 75%.Lowering Health Care Costs for FamiliesThe President knows that too many Americans stare at the ceiling wondering what happens if their spouse gets cancer or child gets sick. He believes that every American has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have access to affordable, quality health care. President Biden passed legislation to lower health care and prescription drug costs for American families, giving families more breathing room. Tomorrow, he will discuss the historic progress we have made on lowering health care costs under his watch, including steps to strengthen Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and steps we must take to build on that progress and give more families the peace of mind of affordable prescriptions and health care. $800 lower health care premiums.A record-setting16.3 million peoplesigned up for ACA coverage this year, and the national uninsured rate hit anall-time lowlast year. That’s thanks in large part to President Biden and Democrats in Congress’ work to lower premiums for ACA coverage by an average of $800 per person per year—along with President Biden’s actions toquadrupleconsumer assistance, increase outreach, and close the “family glitch” loophole that blocked many children and spouses from affordable coverage. Tomorrow, the President will call on Congress to make these savings for American families permanent, so we can continue our work to make health care a right, not a privilege. 60 million Medicare beneficiaries will be protected from skyrocketing drug costs.President Biden took on Big Pharma—and won.Thanks to the new prescription drug law, Medicare will be able to negotiate drug prices and cap out-of-pocket pharmacy costs at $2,000 per year under Part D, and drug companies will pay rebates to Medicare if they try to hike their prices faster than the rate of inflation. For the last six weeks, seniors across the country have been benefiting from key drug pricing protections that are putting money back in their pockets: 1 million surprise medical bills are prevented every month.Before President Biden took office, millions of people received surprise bills for out-of-network care, costing them hundreds or thousands of dollars. The Administration isprotectingmillions of consumers from surprise medical bills through theimplementationof the No Surprises Act, which has already protected 10 million Americans from unfair, undeserved out-of-network charges. $3,000 in savings on hearing aids.In October 2022, over-the-counter hearing aids hit the shelves following arulefrom the Food and Drug Administration. Now, millions of Americans can buy hearing aids for low to moderate hearing loss without a prescription or exam. This is anticipated tosaveAmericans as much as $3,000 per pair, providing more breathing room for the estimated 30 million Americans with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. 39 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid coverage.Missouri, Oklahoma, and South Dakota are the most recent states to expand Medicaid to hundreds of thousands of low-income adults previously locked out of Medicaid coverage. The Administration remains committed to closing the coverage gap in the remaining 11 states, and the President will call on Congress to finish the job. In addition, the Administration also worked with over half the states and DC to extend Medicaid postpartum coverage for millions of women. Promoting CompetitionAs President Biden said at last year’s State of the Union, “capitalism without competition isn’t capitalism. It’s exploitation—and it drives up prices.” Over the past year, the Administration has been delivering for the American people to lower prices, protect workers, and increase competition across the economy. In this year’s State of the Union, the President will highlight progress we need to continue to make to promote competition and protect consumers.Cracking down on junk fees.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is lowering or eliminating the banking and credit card “junk” fees that too many Americans pay. The CFPB announced a proposal that will slash excessive credit card late fees to $8 from approximately $30, which could save consumers up to $9 billion a year in late fees. Last year, the CFPB also targeted overdraft and bounced check fees—making changes that will cut fees by over $1 billion a year. The Department of Transportation (DOT) alsoproposeda rule that would require airlines and online search sites to disclose up front any fees to choose seats including to sit next to one’s child, for baggage, and for changes or cancellations. It also published adashboardof airline policies when flights are delayed or cancelled due to issues under the airlines’ control, leading 9 airlines to change policies to guarantee coverage of hotels and 10 airlines to guarantee coverage of meals.The President will re-state his call on Congress to pass aJunk Fees Prevention Actto ban resort and family seating fees, eliminate unnecessary early termination fees for internet and phone services, and crack down on excessive fees and other practices that drive up ticket prices. DOT will also launch a family seating dashboard to raise awareness about airline policies and undertake a rulemaking to ban these fees.Addressing non-compete agreements.Roughly30 million Americans, including many low-wage workers, are covered by non-compete agreements that can stifle wage growth for American workers by making it more difficult for workers to leave for higher-paying jobs. The Federal Trade Commissionreleaseda proposed rule in January 2023 to ban non-compete clauses, which it estimates will increases wages by $300 billion annually. Lowering ocean shipping costs.Ocean carriers increased their rates byas much as 1,000%during the pandemic. Last June, Congress passed the Ocean Shipping Reform Act heeding the President’s call in the 2022 State of the Union. This legislation will cut costs for shippers, and in turn American families, and ensure fairer treatment for exports from our farmers and ranchers. Lowering meat prices.The Administration has taken a number of steps to increase competition in the meat and poultry markets. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) has also issued proposed regulations under the Packers & Stockyards Act to increasecompetition and market integrityand toprevent abuseof farmers in the poultry growing system. USDA is also using $1 billion toexpandindependent meat processing capacity, so the market isn’t dominated by just a few big players. Helping consumers get the right to repair.The President believes that consumers shouldn’t be restricted by big manufacturers from repairing their own equipment—whether it’s a tractor or a smartphone. After President Biden expressed strong support for the right to repair in his Competition Executive Order, Microsoftconducteda study on the issue and made its Surface devices more easily repairable and Appleannouncedself-service repair for certain devices.Improving safety and accountability in nursing homes.As the President directed in last year’s State of the Union, CMS has taken action tostrengthen oversightof the worst performing nursing homes,preventabuse and Medicare fraud, andimprovefamilies’ ability to comparison shop across nursing homes. In the coming days and months, CMS will announce new actions to increase safety and accountability at nursing homes.Reducing the Deficit by Ensuring the Wealthy and Large Corporations Pay their Fair ShareIn the last two years, the Administration cut the deficit by more than $1.7 trillion—the largest deficit reduction in American history. The President believes we need to continue that progress—and reward work, not wealth.Since coming to office, the President has signed legislation to make the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share and provide tax cuts for working families, while reducing the deficit. Under his plan, no one making under $400,000 per year will pay more in taxes.Billionaire Minimum Tax.President Biden is a capitalist and believes that anyone should be able to become a millionaire or a billionaire. He also believes that it is wrong for America to have a tax code that results in America’s wealthiest households paying a lower tax rate than working families. In a typical year, billionaires pay an average tax rate of just8%. In the State of the Union, he’ll call on Congress to pass his billionaire minimum tax. This minimum tax would make sure that the wealthiest Americans no longer pay a tax rate lower than teachers and firefighters.Surcharge on corporate stock buybacks.Stock buybacks enable corporations to funnel tax-advantaged payouts to wealthy and foreign investors, instead of paying dividends that shareholders are required to pay taxes on. In addition, a number ofexpertshave argued that CEOs—who are compensated mostly in stock—use buybacks to enrich themselves to the detriment of the long-term growth of the company. Last year, oil and gas companies made record profits and invested very little in domestic production and to keep gas prices down—instead they bought their own stock, giving all that profit to their CEOs and shareholders. President Biden signed into law a surcharge on corporate stock buyback, which reduces the differential tax treatment between buybacks and dividends and encourages businesses to invest in their growth and productivity as opposed to paying out corporate executives or funneling tax-preferred profits to foreign shareholders. In the State of the Union, the President will call for quadrupling the tax on corporate stock buybacks.Corporate minimum tax.In 2020,55of the largest corporations that were profitable paid $0 in federal income tax. To end that unfairness in the tax code, President Biden signed into law a 15 percent minimum tax on the profits that large corporations—those with over $1 billion in profits—report to shareholders. This book minimum tax means that it will be harder for companies that say they’re earning a billion in profits to pay tax rates in the single digits on those profits. It also levels the playing field for companies—including small businesses—that are already paying their fair share.Legislation to crack down on tax cheats and create a fairer tax system.Working people pay99%of the taxes they owe on their income from wages and salaries, while the top 1 percent hidesabout 20%of their income from tax, including by funneling it through offshore accounts in tax havens that don’t report earnings.

The president has long sold himself as a self-made billionaire, but a Times investigation found that he received at least $413 million in today’s dollars from his father’s real estate empire, much of it through tax dodges in the 1990s. ByDAVID BARSTOW,SUSANNE CRAIGandRUSS BUETTNER President Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents, an investigation by The New York Times has found. Mr. Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self-made billionaire, and he has long insisted that his father, the legendary New York City builder Fred C. Trump, provided almost no financial help. But The Times’s investigation, based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, reveals that Mr. Trump received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father’s real estate empire, starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day. Much of this money came to Mr. Trump because he helped his parents dodge taxes. He and his siblings set up a sham corporation to disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents, records and interviews show. Records indicate that Mr. Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more. He also helped formulate a strategy to undervalue his parents’ real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns, sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings. These maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue Service, The Times found. The president’s parents, Fred and Mary Trump, transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a tax bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritances. The Trumps paid a total of $52.2 million, or about 5 percent, tax records show. The president declined repeated requests over several weeks to comment for this article. But a lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, provided a written statement on Monday, one day after The Times sent a detailed description of its findings. “The New York Times’s allegations of fraud and tax evasion are 100 percent false, and highly defamatory,” Mr. Harder said. “There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate.” Mr. Harder sought to distance Mr. Trump from the tax strategies used by his family, saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives and tax professionals. “President Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters,” he said. “The affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.” [Readthe full statement] The president’s brother, Robert Trump, issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family: “Our dear father, Fred C. Trump, passed away in June 1999. Our beloved mother, Mary Anne Trump, passed away in August 2000. All appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid. Our father’s estate was closed in 2001 by both the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State tax authorities, and our mother’s estate was closed in 2004. Our family has no other comment on these matters that happened some 20 years ago, and would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents, may God rest their souls.” The Times’s findings raise new questions about Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his income tax returns, breaking with decades of practice by past presidents. According to tax experts, it is unlikely that Mr. Trump would be vulnerable to criminal prosecution for helping his parents evade taxes, because the acts happened too long ago and are past the statute of limitations. There is no time limit, however, on civil fines for tax fraud. The findings are based on interviews with Fred Trump’s former employees and advisers and more than 100,000 pages of documents describing the inner workings and immense profitability of his empire. They include documents culled from public sources — mortgages and deeds, probate records, financial disclosure reports, regulatory records and civil court files. The investigation also draws on tens of thousands of pages of confidential records — bank statements, financial audits, accounting ledgers, cash disbursement reports, invoices and canceled checks. Most notably, the documents include more than 200 tax returns from Fred Trump, his companies and various Trump partnerships and trusts. While the records do not include the president’s personal tax returns and reveal little about his recent business dealings at home and abroad, dozens of corporate, partnership and trust tax returns offer the first public accounting of the income he received for decades from various family enterprises. [11 takeawaysfrom The Times’s investigation] What emerges from this body of evidence is a financial biography of the 45th president fundamentally at odds with the story Mr. Trump has sold in his books, his TV shows and his political life. In Mr. Trump’s version of how he got rich, he was the master dealmaker who broke free of his father’s “tiny” outer-borough operation and parlayed a single $1 million loan from his father (“I had to pay him back with interest!”) into a $10 billion empire that would slap the Trump name on hotels, high-rises, casinos, airlines and golf courses the world over. In Mr. Trump’s version, it was always his guts and gumption that overcame setbacks. Fred Trump was simply a cheerleader. “I built what I built myself,” Mr. Trump has said, a narrative that was long amplified by often-credulous coverage from news organizations, including The Times. Certainly a handful of journalists and biographers, notably Wayne Barrett, Gwenda Blair, David Cay Johnston and Timothy L. O’Brien, have challenged this story, especially the claim of being worth $10 billion. They described how Mr. Trump piggybacked off his father’s banking connections to gain a foothold in Manhattan real estate. They poked holes in his go-to talking point about the $1 million loan, citing evidence that he actually got $14 million. They told how Fred Trump once helped his son make a bond payment on an Atlantic City casino by buying $3.5 million in casino chips. But The Times’s investigation of the Trump family’s finances is unprecedented in scope and precision, offering the first comprehensive look at the inherited fortune and tax dodges that guaranteed Donald J. Trump a gilded life. The reporting makes clear that in every era of Mr. Trump’s life, his finances were deeply intertwined with, and dependent on, his father’s wealth. By age 3, Mr. Trump was earning $200,000 a year in today’s dollars from his father’s empire. He was a millionaire by age 8. By the time he was 17, his father had given him part ownership of a 52-unit apartment building. Soon after Mr. Trump graduated from college, he was receiving the equivalent of $1 million a year from his father. The money increased with the years, to more than $5 million annually in his 40s and 50s. Fred Trump’s real estate empire was not just scores of apartment buildings. It was also a mountain of cash, tens of millions of dollars in profits building up inside his businesses, banking records show. In one six-year span, from 1988 through 1993, Fred Trump reported $109.7 million in total income, now equivalent to $210.7 million. It was not unusual for tens of millions in Treasury bills and certificates of deposit to flow through his personal bank accounts each month. Fred Trump was relentless and creative in finding ways to channel this wealth to his children. He made Donald not just his salaried employee but also his property manager, landlord, banker and consultant. He gave him loan after loan, many never repaid. He provided money for his car, money for his employees, money to buy stocks, money for his first Manhattan offices and money to renovate those offices. He gave him three trust funds. He gave him shares in multiple partnerships. He gave him $10,000 Christmas checks. He gave him laundry revenue from his buildings. Much of his giving was structured to sidestep gift and inheritance taxes using methods tax experts described to The Times as improper or possibly illegal. Although Fred Trump became wealthy with help from federal housing subsidies, he insisted that it was manifestly unfair for the government to tax his fortune as it passed to his children. When he was in his 80s and beginning to slide into dementia, evading gift and estate taxes became a family affair, with Donald Trump playing a crucial role, interviews and newly obtained documents show. The line between legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion is often murky, and it is constantly being stretched by inventive tax lawyers. There is no shortage of clever tax avoidance tricks that have been blessed by either the courts or the I.R.S. itself. The richest Americans almost never pay anything close to full freight. But tax experts briefed on The Times’s findings said the Trumps appeared to have done more than exploit legal loopholes. They said the conduct described here represented a pattern of deception and obfuscation, particularly about the value of Fred Trump’s real estate, that repeatedly prevented the I.R.S. from taxing large transfers of wealth to his children. “The theme I see here through all of this is valuations: They play around with valuations in extreme ways,” said Lee-Ford Tritt, a University of Florida law professor and a leading expert in gift and estate tax law. “There are dramatic fluctuations depending on their purpose.” The manipulation of values to evade taxes was central to one of the most important financial events in Donald Trump’s life. In an episode never before revealed, Mr. Trump and his siblings gained ownership of most of their father’s empire on Nov. 22, 1997, a year and a half before Fred Trump’s death. Critical to the complex transaction was the value put on the real estate. The lower its value, the lower the gift taxes. The Trumps dodged hundreds of millions in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the properties, claiming they were worth just $41.4 million. The same set of buildings would be sold off over the next decade for more than 16 times that amount. The most overt fraud was All County Building Supply & Maintenance, a company formed by the Trump family in 1992. All County’s ostensible purpose was to be the purchasing agent for Fred Trump’s buildings, buying everything from boilers to cleaning supplies. It did no such thing, records and interviews show. Instead All County siphoned millions of dollars from Fred Trump’s empire by simply marking up purchases already made by his employees. Those millions, effectively untaxed gifts, then flowed to All County’s owners — Donald Trump, his siblings and a cousin. Fred Trump then used the padded All County receipts to justify bigger rent increases for thousands of tenants. After this article was published on Tuesday, a spokesman for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance said the agency was “reviewing the allegations” and “vigorously pursuing all appropriate areas of investigation.” All told, The Times documented 295 streams of revenue that Fred Trump created over five decades to enrich his son. In most cases his four other children benefited equally. But over time, as Donald Trump careened from one financial disaster to the next, his father found ways to give him substantially more money, records show. Even so, in 1990, according to previously secret depositions, Mr. Trump tried to have his father’s will rewritten in a way that Fred Trump, alarmed and angered, feared could result in his empire’s being used to bail out his son’s failing businesses. Of course, the story of how Donald Trump got rich cannot be reduced to handouts from his father. Before he became president, his singular achievement was building the brand of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, a brand so potent it generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue through TV shows, books and licensing deals. Constructing that image required more than Fred Trump’s money. Just as important were his son’s preternatural marketing skills and always-be-closing competitive hustle. While Fred Trump helped finance the accouterments of wealth, Donald Trump, master self-promoter, spun them into a seductive narrative. Fred Trump’s money, for example, helped build Trump Tower, the talisman of privilege that established his son as a major player in New York. But Donald Trump recognized and exploited the iconic power of Trump Tower as a primary stage for both “The Apprentice” and his presidential campaign. The biggest payday he ever got from his father came long after Fred Trump’s death. It happened quietly, without the usual Trumpian news conference, on May 4, 2004, when Mr. Trump and his siblings sold off the empire their father had spent 70 years assembling with the dream that it would never leave his family. Donald Trump’s cut: $177.3 million, or $236.2 million in today’s dollars. Early experience, cultivated connections and a wave of federal housing subsidies helped Fred Trump lay the foundation of his son’s wealth. Before he turned 20, Fred Trump had already built and sold his first home. At age 35, he was building hundreds of houses a year in Brooklyn and Queens. By 45, he was building some of the biggest apartment complexes in the country. Aside from an astonishing work ethic — “Sleeping is a waste of time,” he liked to say — the growth reflected his shrewd application of mass-production techniques. The Brooklyn Daily Eagle called him “the Henry Ford of the home-building industry.” He would erect scaffolding a city block long so his masons, sometimes working a second shift under floodlights, could throw up a dozen rowhouses in a week. They sold for about $115,000 in today’s dollars. By 1940, American Builder magazine was taking notice, devoting a spread to Fred Trump under the headline “Biggest One-Man Building Show.” The article described a swaggering lone-wolf character who paid for everything — wages, supplies, land — from a thick wad of cash he carried at all times, and whose only help was a secretary answering the phone in an office barely bigger than a parking space. “He is his own purchasing agent, cashier, paymaster, building superintendent, construction engineer and sales director,” the article said. It wasn’t that simple. Fred Trump had also spent years ingratiating himself with Brooklyn’s Democratic machine, giving money, doing favors and making the sort of friends (like Abraham D. Beame, a future mayor) who could make life easier for a developer. He had also assembled a phalanx of plugged-in real estate lawyers, property appraisers and tax accountants who protected his interests. All these traits — deep experience, nimbleness, connections, a relentless focus on the efficient construction of homes for the middle class — positioned him perfectly to ride a growing wave of federal spending on housing. The wave took shape with the New Deal, grew during the World War II rush to build military housing and crested with the postwar imperative to provide homes for returning G.I.s. Fred Trump would become a millionaire many times over by making himself one of the nation’s largest recipients of cheap government-backed building loans, according to Gwenda Blair’s book “The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President.” Those same loans became the wellspring of Donald Trump’s wealth. In the late 1940s, Fred Trump obtained roughly $26 million in federal loans to build two of his largest developments, Beach Haven Apartments, near Coney Island, Brooklyn, and Shore Haven Apartments, a few miles away. Then he set about making his children his landlords. As ground lease payments fattened his children’s trusts, Fred Trump embarked on a far bigger transfer of wealth. Records obtained by The Times reveal how he began to build or buy apartment buildings in Brooklyn and Queens and then gradually, without public trace, transfer ownership to his children through a web of partnerships and corporations. In all, Fred Trump put up nearly $13 million in cash and mortgage debt to create a mini-empire within his empire — eight buildings with 1,032 apartments — that he would transfer to his children. The handover began just before Donald Trump’s 16th birthday. On June 1, 1962, Fred Trump transferred a plot of land in Queens to a newly created corporation. While he would be its president, his children would be its owners, records show. Then he constructed a 52-unit building called Clyde Hall. It was easy money for the Trump children. Their father took care of everything. He bought the land, built the apartments and obtained the mortgages. His employees managed the building. The profits, meanwhile, went to his children. By the early 1970s, Fred Trump would execute similar transfers of the other seven buildings. The New York Times would like to hear from readers who want to share messages and materials with our journalists.   For Donald Trump, this meant a rapidly growing new source of income. When he was in high school, his cut of the profits was about $17,000 a year in today’s dollars. His share exceeded $300,000 a year soon after he graduated from college. How Fred Trump transferred 1,032 apartments to his children without incurring hundreds of thousands of dollars in gift taxes is unclear. A review of property records for the eight buildings turned up no evidence that his children bought them outright. Financial records obtained by The Times reveal only that all of the shares in the partnerships and corporations set up to create the mini-empire shifted at some point from Fred Trump to his children. Yet his tax returns show he paid no gift taxes on seven of the buildings, and only a few thousand dollars on the eighth. That building, Sunnyside Towers, a 158-unit property in Queens, illustrates Fred Trump’s catch-me-if-you-can approach with the I.R.S., which had repeatedly cited him for underpaying taxes in the 1950s and 1960s. Sunnyside was bought for $2.5 million in 1968 by Midland Associates, a partnership Fred Trump formed with his children for the transaction. In his 1969 tax return, hereported giving each childFred Trump’s 1969 federal gift tax returnRead document15 percent of Midland Associates. Based on the amount of cash put up to buy Sunnyside, the value of this gift should have been $93,750. Instead, he declared a gift of only $6,516. Donald Trump went to work for his father after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in 1968. His father made him vice president of dozens of companies. This was also the moment Fred Trump telegraphed what had become painfully obvious to his family and employees: He did not consider his eldest son, Fred Trump Jr., a viable heir apparent. Fred Jr., seven and a half years older than Donald, had also worked for his father after college. It did not go well, relatives and former employees said in interviews. Fred Trump openly ridiculed him for being too nice, too soft, too lazy, too fond of drink. He frowned on his interests in flying and music, could not fathom why he cared so little for the family business. Donald, witness to his father’s deepening disappointment, fashioned himself Fred Jr.’s opposite — the brash tough guy with a killer instinct. His reward was to inherit his father’s dynastic dreams. Fred Trump began taking steps that enriched Donald alone, introducing him to the charms of building with cheap government loans. In 1972, father and son formed a partnership to build a high-rise for the elderly in East Orange, N.J. Thanks to government subsidies, the partnership got a nearly interest-free $7.8 million loan that covered 90 percent of construction costs. Fred Trump paid the rest. But his son received most of the financial benefits, records show. On top of profit distributions and consulting fees, Donald Trump was paid to manage the building, though Fred Trump’s employees handled day-to-day management. He also pocketed what tenants paid to rent air-conditioners. By 1975, Donald Trump’s take from the building was today’s equivalent of nearly $305,000 a year. Fred Trump also gave his son an extra boost through his investment, in the early 1970s, in the sprawling Starrett City development in Brooklyn, the largest federally subsidized housing project in the nation. The investment, which promised to generate huge tax write-offs, was tailor-made for Fred Trump; he would use Starrett City’s losses to avoid taxes on profits from his empire. Fred Trump invested $5 million. A separate partnership established for his children invested $1 million more, showering tax breaks on the Trump children for decades to come. They helped Donald Trump avoid paying any federal income taxes at all in 1978 and 1979. But Fred Trump also deputized him to sell a sliver of his Starrett City shares, a sweetheart deal that generated today’s equivalent of more than $1 million in “consulting fees.” The money from consulting and management fees, ground leases, the mini-empire and his salary all combined to make Donald Trump indisputably wealthy years before he sold his first Manhattan apartment. By 1975, when he was 29, he had collected nearly $9 million in today’s dollars from his father, The Times found. Wealthy, yes. But a far cry from the image father and son craved for Donald Trump. Fred Trump would play a crucial role in building and carefully maintaining the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire. “He is tall, lean and blond, with dazzling white teeth, and he looks ever so much like Robert Redford. He rides around town in a chauffeured silver Cadillac with his initials, DJT, on the plates. He dates slinky fashion models, belongs to the most elegant clubs and, at only 30 years of age, estimates that he is worth ‘more than $200 million.’” So begana Nov. 1, 1976, article in The Times,one of the first major profiles of Donald Trump and a cornerstone of decades of mythmaking about his wealth. How could he claim to be worth more than $200 million when, as he divulged years later to casino regulators, his 1976 taxable income was $24,594? Donald Trump simply appropriated his father’s entire empire as his own. In the chauffeured Cadillac, Donald Trump took The Times’s reporter on a tour of what he called his “jobs.” He told her about the Manhattan hotel he planned to convert into a Grand Hyatt (his father guaranteed the construction loan), and the Hudson River railroad yards he planned to develop (the rights were purchased by his father’s company). He showed her “our philanthropic endeavor,” the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange (bankrolled by his father), and an apartment complex on Staten Island (owned by his father), and their “flagship,” Trump Village, in Brooklyn (owned by his father), and finally Beach Haven Apartments (owned by his father). Even the Cadillac was leased by his father. “So far,” he boasted, “I’ve never made a bad deal.” It was a spectacular con, right down to the priceless moment when Mr. Trump confessed that he was “publicity shy.” By claiming his father’s wealth as his own, Donald Trump transformed his place in the world. A brash 30-year-old playboy worth more than $200 million proved irresistible to New York City’s bankers, politicians and journalists. Yet for all the spin about cutting his own path in Manhattan, Donald Trump was increasingly dependent on his father. Weeks after The Times’s profile ran, Fred Trump set up still more trusts for his children, seeding each with today’s equivalent of $4.3 million. Even into the early 1980s, when he was already proclaiming himself one of America’s richest men, Donald Trump remained on his father’s payroll, drawing an annual salary of $260,000 in today’s dollars. Meanwhile, Fred Trump and his companies also began extending large loans and lines of credit to Donald Trump. Those loans dwarfed what the other Trumps got, the flow so constant at times that it was as if Donald Trump had his own Money Store. Consider 1979,when he borrowedSampling of money Donald Trump borrowed from his fatherRead document$1.5 million in January, $65,000 in February, $122,000 in March, $150,000 in April, $192,000 in May, $226,000 in June, $2.4 million in July and $40,000 in August, according to records filed with New Jersey casino regulators. In theory, the money had to be repaid. In practice, records show, many of the loans were more like gifts. Some were interest-free and had no repayment schedule. Even when loans charged interest, Donald Trump frequently skipped payments. This previously unreported flood of loans highlights a clear pattern to Fred Trump’s largess. When Donald Trump began expensive new projects, his father increased his help. In the late 1970s, when Donald Trump was converting the old Commodore Hotel into a Grand Hyatt, his father stepped up with a spigot of loans. Fred Trump did the same with Trump Tower in the early 1980s. In the mid-1980s, as Donald Trump made his first forays into Atlantic City, Fred Trump devised a plan that sharply increased the flow of money to his son. The plan involved the mini-empire — the eight buildings Fred Trump had transferred to his children. He converted seven of them into cooperatives, and helped his children convert the eighth. That meant inviting tenants to buy their apartments, generating a three-way windfall for Donald Trump and his siblings: from selling units, from renting unsold units and from collecting mortgage payments. In 1982, Donald Trump made today’s equivalent of about $380,000 from the eight buildings. As the conversions continued and Fred Trump’s employees sold off more units, his son’s share of profits jumped, records show. By 1987, with the conversions completed, his son was making today’s equivalent of $4.5 million a year off the eight buildings. Fred Trump made one other structural change to his empire that produced a big new source of revenue for Donald Trump and his siblings. He made them his bankers. The Times could find no evidence that the Trump children had to come up with money of their own to buy their father’s mortgages. Most were purchased from Fred Trump’s banks by trusts and partnerships that he set up and seeded with money. Co-op sales, mortgage payments, ground leases — Fred Trump was a master at finding ways to enrich his children in general and Donald Trump in particular. Some ways were like slow-moving creeks. Others were rushing streams. A few were geysers. But as the decades passed they all joined into one mighty river of money. By 1990, The Times found, Fred Trump, the ultimate silent partner, had quietly transferred today’s equivalent of at least $46.2 million to his son. Donald Trump took on a mien of invincibility. The stock market crashed in 1987 and the economy cratered. But he doubled down thanks in part to Fred Trump’s banks, which eagerly extended credit to the young Trump princeling. He bought the Plaza Hotel in 1988 for $407.5 million. He bought the Eastern Airlines shuttle fleet in 1989 for $365 million and called it Trump Shuttle. His newest casino, the Trump Taj Mahal, would need at least $1 million a day just to cover its debt. The skeptics who questioned the wisdom of this debt-fueled spending spree were drowned out by one magazine cover after another marveling at someone so young taking such breathtaking risks. But whatever Donald Trump was gambling, not for one second was he at risk of losing out on a lifetime of frictionless, effortless wealth. Fred Trump had that bet covered. Bailouts, collateral, cash on hand — Fred Trump was prepared, and was not about to let bad bets sink his son. As the 1980s ended, Donald Trump’s big bets began to go bust. Trump Shuttle was failing to make loan payments within 15 months. The Plaza, drowning in debt, was bankrupt in four years. His Atlantic City casinos, also drowning in debt, tumbled one by one into bankruptcy. What didn’t fail was the Trump safety net. Just as Donald Trump’s finances were crumbling, family partnerships and companies dramatically increased distributions to him and his siblings. Between 1989 and 1992, tax records show, four entities created by Fred Trump to support his childrenpaid Donald Trump today’s equivalent of $8.3 million. Fred Trump’s generosity also provided a crucial backstop when his son pleaded with bankers in 1990 for an emergency line of credit. With so many of his projects losing money, Donald Trump had few viable assets of his own making to pledge as collateral. What has never been publicly known is that he used his stakes in the mini-empire and the high-rise for the elderly in East Orange as collateral to help secure a $65 million loan. Tax records also reveal that at the peak of Mr. Trump’s financial distress, his father extracted extraordinary sums from his empire. In 1990,Fred Trump’s incomeFirst two pages of Fred Trump’s 1990 income tax returnRead documentexploded to $49,638,928 — several times what he paid himself in other years in that era. Fred Trump, former employees say, detested taking unnecessary distributions from his companies because he would have to pay income taxes on them. So why would a penny-pinching, tax-hating 85-year-old in the twilight of his career abruptly pull so much money out of his cherished properties, incurring a tax bill of $12.2 million? The Times found no evidence that Fred Trump made any significant debt payments or charitable donations. The frugality he brought to business carried over to the rest of his life. According to ledgers of his personal spending, he spent a grand total of $8,562 in 1991 and 1992 on travel and entertainment. His extravagances, such as they were, consisted of buying his wife the odd gift from Antonovich Furs or hosting family celebrations at the Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn. His home on Midland Parkway in Jamaica Estates, Queens, built with unfussy brick like so many of his apartment buildings, had little to distinguish it from neighboring houses beyond the white columns and crest framing the front door. There are, however, indications that he wanted plenty of cash on hand to bail out his son if need be. Such was the case with the rescue mission at his son’s Trump’s Castle casino. Donald Trump had wildly overspent on renovations, leaving the property dangerously low on operating cash. Sure enough, neither Trump’s Castle nor its owner had the necessary funds to make an $18.4 million bond payment due in December 1990. On Dec. 17, 1990, Fred Trump dispatched Howard Snyder, a trusted bookkeeper, to Atlantic City with a $3.35 million check. Mr. Snyder bought $3.35 million worth of casino chips and left without placing a bet. Apparently, even this infusion wasn’t sufficient, because that same day Fred Trump wrotea second check to Trump’s Castle, for $150,000, bank records show. With this ruse — it was an illegal $3.5 million loan under New Jersey gaming laws, resulting in a $65,000 civil penalty — Donald Trump narrowly avoided defaulting on his bonds. Both the son and the father were masters of manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs. As the chip episode demonstrated, father and son were of one mind about rules and regulations, viewing them as annoyances to be finessed or, when necessary, ignored. As described by family members and associates in interviews and sworn testimony, theirs was an intimate, endless confederacy sealed by blood, shared secrets and a Hobbesian view of what it took to dominate and win. They talked almost daily and saw each other most weekends. Donald Trump sat at his father’s right hand at family meals and participated in his father’s monthly strategy sessions with his closest advisers. Fred Trump was a silent, watchful presence at many of Donald Trump’s news conferences. “I probably knew my father as well or better than anybody,” Donald Trump said in a 2000 deposition. They were both fluent in the language of half-truths and lies, interviews and records show. They both delighted in transgressing without getting caught. They were both wizards at manipulating the value of their assets, making them appear worth a lot or a little depending on their needs. Those talents came in handy when Fred Trump Jr. died, on Sept. 26, 1981, at age 42 from complications of alcoholism, leaving a son and a daughter. The executors of his estate were his father and his brother Donald. Fred Trump Jr.’s largest asset was his stake in seven of the eight buildings his father had transferred to his children. The Trumps would claim that those properties were worth $90.4 million when they finished converting them to cooperatives within a few years of his death. At that value, his stake could have generated an estate tax bill of nearly $10 million. But the tax return signed by Donald Trump and his father claimed thatFred Trump Jr.’s estate owedjust $737,861. This result was achieved by lowballing all seven buildings. Instead of valuing them at $90.4 million, Fred and Donald Trump submitted appraisals putting them at $13.2 million. Emblematic of their audacity was Park Briar, a 150-unit building in Queens. As it happened, 18 days before Fred Trump Jr.’s death, the Trump siblings had submitted Park Briar’s co-op conversion plan, stating under oath that the building was worth $17.1 million. Yet as Fred Trump Jr.’s executors, Donald Trump and his fatherclaimed on the tax return that Park Briar was worth $2.9 millionPark Briar valuation in Fred Trump Jr.’s willRead documentwhen Fred Trump Jr. died. This fantastical claim — that Park Briar should be taxed as if its value had fallen 83 percent in 18 days — slid past the I.R.S. with barely a protest. An auditor insisted the value should be increased by $100,000, to $3 million. During the 1980s, Donald Trump became notorious for leaking word that he was taking positions in stocks, hinting of a possible takeover, and then either selling on the run-up or trying to extract lucrative concessions from the target company to make him go away. It was a form of stock manipulation with an unsavory label: “greenmailing.” The Times unearthed evidence that Mr. Trump enlisted his father as his greenmailing wingman. On Jan. 26, 1989, Fred Trump bought 8,600 shares of Time Inc. for $934,854, his tax returns show. Seven days later, Dan Dorfman, a financial columnist known to be chatty with Donald Trump, broke the news that the younger Trump had “taken a sizable stake” in Time. Sure enough, Time’s shares jumped, allowing Fred Trump to make a $41,614 profit in two weeks. Later that year, Fred Trump bought $5 million worth of American Airlines stock. Based on the share price — $81.74 — it appears he made the purchase shortly before Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump was taking a stake in the company. Within weeks, the stock was over $100 a share. Had Fred Trump sold then, he would have made a quick $1.3 million. But he didn’t, and the stock sank amid skepticism about his son’s history of hyped takeover attempts that fizzled. Fred Trump sold his shares for a $1.7 million loss in January 1990. A week later, Mr. Dorfman reported that Donald Trump had sold, too. With other family members, Fred Trump could be cantankerous and cruel, according to sworn testimony by his relatives. “This is the stupidest thing I ever heard of,” he’d snap when someone disappointed him. He was different with his son Donald. He might chide him — “Finish this job before you start that job,” he’d counsel — but more often, he looked for ways to forgive and accommodate. By 1987, for example, Donald Trump’s loan debt to his father had grown to at least $11 million. Yet canceling the debt would have required Donald Trump to pay millions in taxes on the amount forgiven. Father and son found another solution, one never before disclosed, that appears to constitute both an unreported multimillion-dollar gift and a potentially illegal tax write-off. In December 1987, records show, Fred Trump bought a 7.5 percent stake in Trump Palace, a 55-story condominium building his son was erecting on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Most, if not all, of his investment, which totaled $15.5 million, was made by exchanging his son’s unpaid debts for Trump Palace shares, records show. Four years later, in December 1991,Fred Trump sold his entire stake in Trump PalaceRecord of one of the Trump Palace investmentsRead documentfor just $10,000,his tax returns and financial statements reveal.Tax document showing most of the write-offs for the Trump Palace investmentsRead documentThose documents do not identify who bought his stake. But other records indicate that he sold it back to his son. Under state law, developers must file “offering plans” that identify to any potential condo buyer the project’s sponsors — in other words, its owners. The Trump Palace offering plan, submitted in November 1989, identified two owners: Donald Trump and his father. But under the same law, if Fred Trump had sold his stake to a third party, Donald Trump would have been required to identify the new owner in an amended offering plan filed with the state attorney general’s office. He did not do that, records show. He did, however, sign a sworn affidavit a month after his father sold his stake. In the affidavit, submitted in a lawsuit over a Trump Palace contractor’s unpaid bill, Donald Trump identified himself as “the” owner of Trump Palace. Under I.R.S. rules, selling shares worth $15.5 million to your son for $10,000 is tantamount to giving him a $15.49 million taxable gift. Fred Trump reported no such gift. According to tax experts, the only circumstance that would not have required Fred Trump to report a gift was if Trump Palace had been effectively bankrupt when he unloaded his shares. Yet Trump Palace was far from bankrupt. Property records show that condo sales there were brisk in 1991. Trump Palace sold 57 condos for $52.5 million — 94 percent of the total asking price for those units. Donald Trump himself proclaimed Trump Palace “the most financially secure condominium on the market today” in advertisements he placed in 1991 to rebut criticism from buyers who complained that his business travails could drag down Trump Palace, too. In December, 17 days before his father sold his shares, he placed an ad vouching for the wisdom of investing in Trump Palace:“Smart money says there has never been a better time.”Advertisement for Trump PalaceRead document By failing to tell the I.R.S. about his $15.49 million gift to his son, Fred Trump evaded the 55 percent tax on gifts, saving about $8 million. At the same time, he declared to the I.R.S. that Trump Palace was almost a complete loss — that he had walked away from a $15.5 million investment with just $10,000 to show for it. Federal tax law prohibits deducting any loss from the sale of property between members of the same family, because of the potential for abuse. Yet Fred Trump appears to have done exactly that, dodging roughly $5 million more in income taxes. The partnership between Fred and Donald Trump was not simply about the pursuit of riches. At its heart lay a more ambitious project, executed to perfection over decades — to create that origin story, the myth of Donald J. Trump, Self-Made Billionaire. Donald Trump built the foundation for the myth in the 1970s by appropriating his father’s empire as his own. By the late 1980s, instead of appropriating the empire, he was diminishing it. “It wasn’t a great business, it was a good business,” he said, as if Fred Trump ran a chain of laundromats. Yes, he told interviewers, his father was a wonderful mentor, but given the limits of his business, the most he could manage was a $1 million loan, and even that had to be repaid with interest. Through it all, Fred Trump played along. Never once did he publicly question his son’s claim about the $1 million loan. “Everything he touches seems to turn to gold,” he told The Times for that first profile in 1976.“He’s gone way beyond me, absolutely,”he said when The Times profiled his son again in 1983. But for all Fred Trump had done to build the myth of Donald Trump, Self-Made Billionaire, there was, it turned out, one line he would not allow his son to cross. Donald Trump tried to change his ailing father’s will, prompting a backlash — but also a recognition that plans had to be set in motion before Fred Trump died. Fred Trump had given careful thought to what would become of his empire after he died, and had hired one of the nation’s top estate lawyers to draft his will. But in December 1990, Donald Trump sent his father a document, drafted by one of his own lawyers, that sought to make significant changes to that will. Fred Trump, then 85, had never before set eyes on the document, 12 pages of dense legalese. Nor had he authorized its preparation. Nor had he met the lawyer who drafted it. Yet his son sent instructions that he needed to sign it immediately. What happened next was described years later in sworn depositions by members of the Trump family during a dispute, later settled, over the inheritance Fred Trump left to Fred Jr.’s children. These depositions, obtained by The Times, reveal something startling: Fred Trump believed that the document potentially put his life’s work at risk. The document, known as a codicil,First page of codicil to Fred Trump’s willRead documentdid many things. It protected Donald Trump’s portion of the inheritance from his creditors and from his impending divorce settlement with his first wife, Ivana Trump. It strengthened provisions in the existing will making him the sole executor of his father’s estate. But more than any of the particulars, it was the entirety of the codicil and its presentation as a fait accompli that alarmed Fred Trump, the depositions show. He confided to family members that he viewed the codicil as an attempt to go behind his back and give his son total control over his affairs. He said he feared that it could let Donald Trump denude his empire, even using it as collateral to rescue his failing businesses. (It was, in fact, the very month of the $3.5 million casino rescue.) As close as they were — or perhaps because they were so close — Fred Trump did not immediately confront his son. Instead he turned to his daughter Maryanne Trump Barry, then a federal judge whom he often consulted on legal matters. “This doesn’t pass the smell test,” he told her, she recalled during her deposition. When Judge Barry read the codicil, she reached the same conclusion. “Donald was in precarious financial straits by his own admission,” she said, “and Dad was very concerned as a man who worked hard for his money and never wanted any of it to leave the family.” (In a brief telephone interview, Judge Barry declined to comment.) Fred Trump took prompt action to thwart his son. He dispatched his daughter to find new estate lawyers. One of them took notes on the instructions she passed on from her father: “Protect assets from DJT, Donald’s creditors.” The lawyers quickly drafted a new codicil stripping Donald Trump of sole control over his father’s estate. Fred Trump signed it immediately. Clumsy as it was, Donald Trump’s failed attempt to change his father’s will brought a family reckoning about two related issues: Fred Trump’s declining health and his reluctance to relinquish ownership of his empire. Surgeons had removed a neck tumor a few years earlier, and he would soon endure hip replacement surgery and be found to have mild senile dementia. Yet for all the financial support he had lavished on his children, for all his abhorrence of taxes, Fred Trump had stubbornly resisted his advisers’ recommendations to transfer ownership of his empire to the children to minimize estate taxes. With every passing year, the actuarial odds increased that Fred Trump would die owning apartment buildings worth many hundreds of millions of dollars, all of it exposed to the 55 percent estate tax. Just as exposed was the mountain of cash he was sitting on. His buildings, well maintained and carrying little debt, consistently produced millions of dollars a year in profits. Even after he paid himself $109.7 million from 1988 through 1993, his companies were holding $50 million in cash and investments, financial records show. Tens of millions of dollars more passed each month through a maze of personal accounts at Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, UBS, Bowery Savings and United Mizrahi, an Israeli bank. Simply put, without immediate action, Fred Trump’s heirs faced the prospect of losing hundreds of millions of dollars to estate taxes. Whatever their differences, the Trumps formulated a plan to avoid this fate. How they did it is a story never before told. It is also a story in which Donald Trump played a central role. He took the lead in strategy sessions where the plan was devised with the consent and participation of his father and his father’s closest advisers, people who attended the meetings told The Times. Robert Trump, the youngest sibling and the beta to Donald’s alpha, was given the task of overseeing day-to-day details. After years of working for his brother, Robert Trump went to work for his father in late 1991. The Trumps’ plan, executed over the next decade, blended traditional techniques — such as rewriting Fred Trump’s will to maximize tax avoidance — with unorthodox strategies that tax experts told The Times were legally dubious and, in some cases, appeared to be fraudulent. As a result, the Trump children would gain ownership of virtually all of their father’s buildings without having to pay a penny of their own. They would turn the mountain of cash into a molehill of cash. And hundreds of millions of dollars that otherwise would have gone to the United States Treasury would instead go to Fred Trump’s children. A family company let Fred Trump funnel money to his children by effectively overcharging himself for repairs and improvements on his properties. One of the first steps came on Aug. 13, 1992, when the Trumps incorporated a company namedAll County Building Supply & Maintenance.First page of All County incorporation papersRead document All County had no corporate offices. Its address was the Manhasset, N.Y., home of John Walter, a favorite nephew of Fred Trump’s. Mr. Walter, who died in January, spent decades working for Fred Trump, primarily helping computerize his payroll and billing systems. He also was the unofficial keeper of Fred Trump’s personal and business papers, his basement crowded with boxes of old Trump financial records. John Walter and the four Trump children each owned 20 percent of All County, records show. All County’s main purpose, The Times found, was to enable Fred Trump to make large cash gifts to his children and disguise them as legitimate business transactions, thus evading the 55 percent tax. The way it worked was remarkably simple. Each year Fred Trump spent millions of dollars maintaining and improving his properties. Some of the vendors who supplied his building superintendents and maintenance crews had been cashing Fred Trump’s checks for decades. Starting in August 1992, though, a different name began to appear on their checks — All County Building Supply & Maintenance. Mr. Walter’s computer systems, meanwhile, churned out All County invoices that billed Fred Trump’s empire for those same services and supplies, with one difference: All County’s invoices were padded, marked up by 20 percent, or 50 percent, or even more, records show. The Trump siblings split the markup, along with Mr. Walter. The self-dealing at the heart of this arrangement was best illustrated by Robert Trump, whose father paid him a $500,000 annual salary.He approved many of the payments Fred Trump’s empire made to All County; he was also All County’s chief executive, as well as a co-owner.Sampling of checks to All County from Fred Trump businesses, signed by Robert or Fred TrumpRead documentAs for the work of All County — generating invoices — that fell to Mr. Walter, also on Fred Trump’s payroll, along with a personal assistant Mr. Walter paid to work on his side businesses. Years later, in his deposition during the dispute over Fred Trump’s estate, Robert Trump would say that All County actually saved Fred Trump money by negotiating better deals. Given Fred Trump’s long experience expertly squeezing better prices out of contractors, it was a surprising claim. It was also not true. The Times’s examination of thousands of pages of financial documents from Fred Trump’s buildings shows that his costs shot up once All County entered the picture. Beach Haven Apartments illustrates how this happened: In 1991 and 1992, Fred Trump bought 78 refrigerator-stove combinations for Beach Haven from Long Island Appliance Wholesalers. The average price was $642.69. But in 1993, when he began paying All County for refrigerator-stove combinations, the price jumped by 46 percent. Likewise, the price he paid for trash-compacting services at Beach Haven increased 64 percent. Janitorial supplies went up more than 100 percent. Plumbing repairs and supplies rose 122 percent. And on it went in building after building. The more Fred Trump paid, the more All County made, which was precisely the plan. While All County systematically overcharged Fred Trump for thousands of items, the job of negotiating with vendors fell, as it always had, to Fred Trump and his staff. Leon Eastmond can attest to this. Mr. Eastmond is the owner of A. L. Eastmond & Sons, a Bronx company that makes industrial boilers. In 1993, he and Fred Trump met at Gargiulo’s, an old-school Italian restaurant in Coney Island that was one of Fred Trump’s favorites, to hash out the price of 60 boilers. Fred Trump, accompanied by his secretary and Robert Trump, drove a hard bargain. After negotiating a 10 percent discount, he made one last demand: “I had to pay the tab,” Mr. Eastmond recalled with a chuckle. There was no mention of All County. Mr. Eastmond first heard of the company when its checks started rolling in. “I remember opening my mail one day and out came a check for $100,000,” he recalled. “I didn’t recognize the company. I didn’t know who the hell they were.” But as All County paid Mr. Eastmond the price negotiated by Fred Trump, its invoices to Fred Trump were padded by 20 to 25 percent, records obtained by The Times show.This added hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of the 60 boilers, money that then flowed through All County to Fred Trump’s children without incurring any gift tax.All County purchase order and invoiceRead document All County’s owners devised another ruse to profit off Mr. Eastmond’s boilers. To win Fred Trump’s business, Mr. Eastmond had also agreed to provide mobile boilers for Fred Trump’s buildings free of charge while new boilers were being installed. Yet All County charged Fred Trump rent on the same mobile boilers Mr. Eastmond was providing free, along with hookup fees, disconnection fees, transportation fees and operating and maintenance fees, records show. These charges siphoned hundreds of thousands of dollars more from Fred Trump’s empire. Mr. Walter, asked during a deposition why Fred Trump chose not to make himself one of All County’s owners, replied, “He said because he would have to pay a death tax on it.” After being briefed on All County by The Times, Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said the Trumps’ use of the company was “highly suspicious” and could constitute criminal tax fraud. “It certainly looks like a disguised gift,” he said. While All County was all upside for Donald Trump and his siblings, it had an insidious downside for Fred Trump’s tenants. As an owner of rent-stabilized buildings in New York, Fred Trump needed state approval to raise rents beyond the annual increases set by a government board. One way to justify a rent increase was to make a major capital improvement. It did not take much to get approval; an invoice or canceled check would do if the expense seemed reasonable. The Trumps used the padded All County invoices to justify higher rent increases in Fred Trump’s rent-regulated buildings. Fred Trump, according to Mr. Walter, saw All County as a way to have his cake and eat it, too. If he used his “expert negotiating ability” to buy a $350 refrigerator for $200, he could raise the rent based only on that $200, not on the $350 sticker price “a normal person” would pay, Mr. Walter explained. All County was the way around this problem. “You have to understand the thinking that went behind this,” he said. As Robert Trump acknowledged in his deposition, “The higher the markup would be, the higher the rent that might be charged.” State records show that after All County’s creation, the Trumps got approval to raise rents on thousands of apartments by claiming more than $30 million in major capital improvements. Tenants repeatedly protested the increases, almost always to no avail, the records show. One of the improvements most often cited by the Trumps: new boilers. “All of this smells like a crime,” said Adam S. Kaufmann, a former chief of investigations for the Manhattan district attorney’s office who is now a partner at the law firmLewis Baach Kaufmann Middlemiss. While the statute of limitations has long since lapsed, Mr. Kaufmann said the Trumps’ use of All County would have warranted investigation for defrauding tenants, tax fraud and filing false documents. Mr. Harder, the president’s lawyer, disputed The Times’s reporting: “Should The Times state or imply that President Trump participated in fraud, tax evasion or any other crime, it will be exposing itself to substantial liability and damages for defamation.” All County was not the only company the Trumps set up to drain cash from Fred Trump’s empire. A lucrative income source for Fred Trump was the management fees he charged his buildings. His primary management company, Trump Management,earned $6.8 million in 1993 alone.First page of Trump Management’s 1993 tax returnRead documentThe Trumps found a way to redirect those fees to the children, too. On Jan. 21, 1994, they created a company called Apartment Management Associates Inc., with a mailing address at Mr. Walter’s Manhasset home. Two months later, records show, Apartment Management started collecting fees that had previously gone to Trump Management. The only difference was that Donald Trump and his siblings owned Apartment Management. Between All County and Apartment Management, Fred Trump’s mountain of cash was rapidly dwindling. By 1998, records show, All County and Apartment Management were generating today’s equivalent of $2.2 million a yearfor each of the Trump children.Distributions over a 17-month period reported by Maryanne Trump Barry in 1999Read documentWhatever income tax they owed on this money, it was considerably less than the 55 percent tax Fred Trump would have owed had he simply given each of them $2.2 million a year. But these savings were trivial compared with those that would come when Fred Trump transferred his empire — the actual bricks and mortar — to his children. The transfer of most of Fred Trump’s empire to his children began with a ‘friendly’ appraisal and an incredible shrinking act. In his 90th year, Fred Trump still showed up at work a few days a week, ever dapper in suit and tie. But he had trouble remembering names — his dementia was getting worse — and he could get confused. In May 1995, with an unsteady hand, he signeddocuments granting Robert Trump power of attorneyRobert Trump granted power of attorneyRead documentto act “in my name, place and stead.” Six months later, on Nov. 22, the Trumps began transferring ownership of most of Fred Trump’s empire. (A few properties were excluded.) The instrument they used to do this was a special type of trust with a clunky acronym only a tax lawyer could love: GRAT, short for grantor-retained annuity trust. GRATs are one of the tax code’s great gifts to the ultrawealthy. They let dynastic families like the Trumps pass wealth from one generation to the next — be it stocks, real estate, even art collections — without paying a dime of estate taxes. The details are numbingly complex, but the mechanics are straightforward. For the Trumps, it meant putting half the properties to be transferred into a GRAT in Fred Trump’s name and the other half into a GRAT in his wife’s name. Then Fred and Mary Trump gave their children roughly two-thirds of the assets in their GRATs. The children bought the remaining third by making annuity payments to their parents over the next two years. By Nov. 22, 1997, it was done; the Trump children owned nearly all of Fred Trump’s empire free and clear of estate taxes. As for gift taxes, the Trumps found a way around those, too. The entire transaction turned on one number: the market value of Fred Trump’s empire. This determined the amount of gift taxes Fred and Mary Trump owed for the portion of the empire they gave to their children. It also determined the amount of annuity payments their children owed for the rest. The I.R.S. recognizes that GRATs create powerful incentives to greatly undervalue assets, especially when those assets are not publicly traded stocks with transparent prices. Indeed, every $10 million reduction in the valuation of Fred Trump’s empire would save the Trumps either $10 million in annuity payments or $5.5 million in gift taxes. This is why the I.R.S. requires families taking advantage of GRATs to submit independent appraisals and threatens penalties for those who lowball valuations. In practice, though, gift tax returns get little scrutiny from the I.R.S. It is an open secret among tax practitioners that evasion of gift taxes is rampant and rarely prosecuted. Punishment, such as it is, usually consists of an auditor’s requiring a tax payment closer to what should have been paid in the first place. “GRATs are typically structured so that no tax is due, which means the I.R.S. has reduced incentive to audit them,” said Mitchell Gans, a professor of tax law at Hofstra University. “So if a gift is in fact undervalued, it may very well go unnoticed.” This appears to be precisely what the Trumps were counting on. The Times found evidence that the Trumps dodged hundreds of millions of dollars in gift taxes by submitting tax returns that grossly undervalued the real estate assets they placed in Fred and Mary Trump’s GRATs. According to Fred Trump’s 1995 gift tax return, obtained by The Times, the Trumps claimed that properties including 25 apartment complexes with 6,988 apartments — and twice the floor space of the Empire State Building —were worth just $41.4 million.Fred Trump’s 1995 federal gift tax returnRead documentThe implausibility of this claim would be made plain in 2004, when banks put a valuation of nearly $900 million on that same real estate. The methods the Trumps used to pull off this incredible shrinking act were hatched in the strategy sessions Donald Trump participated in during the early 1990s, documents and interviews show. Their basic strategy had two components: Get what is widely known as a “friendly” appraisal of the empire’s worth, then drive that number even lower by changing the ownership structure to make the empire look less valuable to the I.R.S. A crucial step was finding a property appraiser attuned to their needs. As anyone who has ever bought or sold a home knows, appraisers can arrive at sharply different valuations depending on their methods and assumptions. And like stock analysts, property appraisers have been known to massage those methods and assumptions in ways that coincide with their clients’ interests. The Trumps used Robert Von Ancken, a favorite of New York City’s big real estate families. Over a 45-year career, Mr. Von Ancken has appraised many of the city’s landmarks, including Rockefeller Center, the World Trade Center, the Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building. Donald Trump recruited him after Fred Trump Jr. died and the family needed friendly appraisals to help shield the estate from taxes. Mr. Von Ancken appraised the 25 apartment complexes and other properties in the Trumps’ GRATs and concluded that their total value was $93.9 million, tax records show. To assess the accuracy of those valuations, The Times examined the prices paid for comparable apartment buildings that sold within a year of Mr. Von Ancken’s appraisals. A pattern quickly emerged. Again and again, buildings in the same neighborhood as Trump buildings sold for two to four times as much per square foot as Mr. Von Ancken’s appraisals, even when the buildings were decades older, had fewer amenities and smaller apartments, and were deemed less valuable by city property tax appraisers. Mr. Von Ancken valued Argyle Hall, a six-story brick Trump building in Brooklyn, at $9.04 per square foot. Six blocks away, another six-story brick building, two decades older, had sold a few months earlier for nearly $30 per square foot. He valued Belcrest Hall, a Trump building in Queens, at $8.57 per square foot. A few blocks away, another six-story brick building, four decades older with apartments a third smaller, sold for $25.18 per square foot. The pattern persisted with Fred Trump’s higher-end buildings. Mr. Von Ancken appraised Lawrence Towers, a Trump building in Brooklyn with spacious balcony apartments, at $24.54 per square foot. A few months earlier, an apartment building abutting car repair shops a mile away, with units 20 percent smaller, had sold for $48.23 per square foot. The Times found even starker discrepancies when comparing the GRAT appraisals against appraisals commissioned by the Trumps when they had an incentive to show the highest possible valuations. Such was the case with Patio Gardens, a complex of nearly 500 apartments in Brooklyn. Of all Fred Trump’s properties, Patio Gardens was one of the least profitable, which may be why he decided to use it as a tax deduction. In 1992, he donated Patio Gardens to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/New Jersey, one of the largest charitable donations he ever made. The greater the value of Patio Gardens, the bigger his deduction. The appraisal cited in Fred Trump’s 1992 tax return valued Patio Gardens at $34 million, or $61.90 a square foot. By contrast, Mr. Von Ancken’s GRAT appraisals found that the crown jewels of Fred Trump’s empire, Beach Haven and Shore Haven, with five times as many apartments as Patio Gardens, were together worth just $23 million, or $11.01 per square foot. In an interview, Mr. Von Ancken said that because neither he nor The Times had the working papers that described how he arrived at his valuations, there was simply no way to evaluate the methodologies behind his numbers. “There would be explanations within the appraisals to justify all the values,” he said, adding, “Basically, when we prepare these things, we feel that these are going to be presented to the Internal Revenue Service for their review, and they better be right.” Of all the GRAT appraisals Mr. Von Ancken did for the Trumps, the most startling was for 886 rental apartments in two buildings at Trump Village, a complex in Coney Island. Mr. Von Ancken claimed that they were worth less than nothing — negative $5.9 million, to be exact. These were the same 886 units that city tax assessors valued that same year at $38.1 million, and that a bank would value at $106.6 million in 2004. It appears Mr. Von Ancken arrived at his negative valuation by departing from the methodology that he has repeatedly testified is most appropriate for properties like Trump Village, where past years’ profits are a poor gauge of future value. In 1992, the Trumps had removed the two Trump Village buildings from an affordable housing program so they could raise rents and increase their profits. But doing so cost them a property tax exemption, which temporarily put the buildings in the red. The methodology described by Mr. Von Ancken would have disregarded this blip into the red and valued the buildings based on the higher rents the Trumps would be charging. Mr. Von Ancken, however, appears to have based his valuation on the blip, producing an appraisal that, taken at face value, meant Fred Trump would have had to pay someone millions of dollars to take the property off his hands. Mr. Von Ancken told The Times that he did not recall which appraisal method he used on the two Trump Village buildings. “I can only say that we value the properties based on market information, and based on the expected income and expenses of the building and what they would sell for,” he said. As for the enormous gaps between his valuation and the 1995 city property tax appraisal and the 2004 bank valuation, he argued that such comparisons were pointless. “I can’t say what happened afterwards,” he said. “Maybe they increased the income tremendously.” To further whittle the empire’s valuation, the family created the appearance that Fred Trump held only 49.8 percent. Armed with Mr. Von Ancken’s $93.9 million appraisal, the Trumps focused on slashing even this valuation by changing the ownership structure of Fred Trump’s empire. The I.R.S. has long accepted the idea that ownership with control is more valuable than ownership without control. Someone with a controlling interest in a building can decide if and when the building is sold, how it is marketed and what price to accept. However, since someone who owns, say, 10 percent of a $100 million building lacks control over any of those decisions, the I.R.S. will let him claim that his stake should be taxed as if it were worth only $7 million or $8 million. But Fred Trump had exercised total control over his empire for more than seven decades. With rare exceptions, he owned 100 percent of his buildings. So the Trumps set out to create the fiction that Fred Trump was a minority owner. All it took was splitting the ownership structure of his empire. Fred and Mary Trump each ended up with 49.8 percent of the corporate entities that owned his buildings. The other 0.4 percent was split among their four children. Splitting ownership into minority interests is a widely used method of tax avoidance. There is one circumstance, however, where it has at times been found to be illegal. It involves what is known in tax law as the step transaction doctrine — where it can be shown that the corporate restructuring was part of a rapid sequence of seemingly separate maneuvers actually conceived and executed to dodge taxes. A key issue, according to tax experts, is timing — in the Trumps’ case, whether they split up Fred Trump’s empire just before they set up the GRATs. In all, the Trumps broke up 12 corporate entities to create the appearance of minority ownership. The Times could not determine when five of the 12 companies were divided. But records reveal that the other seven were split up just before the GRATs were established. The pattern was clear. For decades, the companies had been owned solely by Fred Trump, each operating a different apartment complex or shopping center. In September 1995, the Trumps formed seven new limited liability companies. Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 8, they transferred the deeds to the seven properties into their respective L.L.C.’s. On Nov. 21, they recorded six of the deed transfers in public property records. (The seventh was recorded on Nov. 24.) And on Nov. 22, 49.8 percent of the shares in these seven L.L.C.’s was transferred into Fred Trump’s GRAT and 49.8 percent into Mary Trump’s GRAT. That enabled the Trumps to slash Mr. Von Ancken’s valuation in a way that was legally dubious. They claimed that Fred and Mary Trump’s status as minority owners, plus the fact that a building couldn’t be sold as easily as a share of stock, entitled them to lop 45 percent off Mr. Von Ancken’s $93.9 million valuation. This claim, combined with $18.3 million more in standard deductions, completed the alchemy of turning real estate that would soon be valued at nearly $900 million into $41.4 million. According to tax experts, claiming a 45 percent discount was questionable even back then, and far higher than the 20 to 30 percent discount the I.R.S. would allow today. As it happened, the Trumps’ GRATs did not completely elude I.R.S. scrutiny. Documents obtained by The Times reveal thatthe I.R.S. audited Fred Trump’s 1995 gift tax returnI.R.S. audit summary of Fred Trump’s 1995 gift tax returnRead documentand concluded that Fred Trump and his wife had significantly undervalued the assets being transferred through their GRATs. The I.R.S. determined that the Trumps’ assets were worth $57.1 million, 38 percent more than the couple had claimed. From the perspective of an I.R.S. auditor, pulling in nearly $5 million in additional revenue could be considered a good day’s work. For the Trumps, getting the I.R.S. to agree that Fred Trump’s properties were worth only $57.1 million was a triumph. “All estate matters were handled by licensed attorneys, licensed C.P.A.s and licensed real estate appraisers who followed all laws and rules strictly,” Mr. Harder, the president’s lawyer, said in his statement. In the end, the transfer of the Trump empire cost Fred and Mary Trump $20.5 million in gift taxes and their children $21 million in annuity payments. That is hundreds of millions of dollars less than they would have paid based on the empire’s market value, The Times found. Better still for the Trump children, they did not have to pay out a penny of their own. They simply used their father’s empire as collateral to securea line of credit from M&T Bank.Line of credit from M&T BankRead documentThey used the line of credit to make the $21 million in annuity payments, then used the revenue from their father’s empire to repay the money they had borrowed. On the day the Trump children finally took ownership of Fred Trump’s empire, Donald Trump’s net worth instantly increased by many tens of millions of dollars. And from then on, the profits from his father’s empire would flow directly to him and his siblings. The next year, 1998, Donald Trump’s share amounted to today’s equivalent of $9.6 million, The Times found. This sudden influx of wealth came only weeks after he had published “The Art of the Comeback.” “I learned a lot about myself during these hard times,” he wrote. “I learned about handling pressure. I was able to home in, buckle down, get back to the basics, and make things work. I worked much harder, I focused, and I got myself out of a box.” Over 244 pages he did not mention that he was being handed nearly 25 percent of his father’s empire. After Fred Trump’s death, his children used familiar methods to devalue what little of his life’s work was stillin his name. During Fred Trump’s final years, dementia stole most of his memories. When family visited, there was one name he could reliably put to a face. Donald. On June 7, 1999, Fred Trump was admitted to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, not far from the house in Jamaica Estates, for treatment of pneumonia. He died there on June 25, at the age of 93. Fifteen months later, Fred Trump’s executors — Donald, Maryanne and Robert — filed his estate tax return. The return, obtained by The Times, vividly illustrates the effectiveness of the tax strategies devised by the Trumps in the early 1990s. Fred Trump, one of the most prolific New York developers of his time, owned just five apartment complexes, two small strip malls and a scattering of co-ops in the city upon his death. The man who paid himself $50 million in 1990 died with just $1.9 million in the bank. He owned not a single stock, bond or Treasury bill. According to his estate tax return, his most valuable asset was a $10.3 million I.O.U. from Donald Trump, money his son appears to have borrowed the year before Fred Trump died. The bulk of Fred Trump’s empire was nowhere to be found on his estate tax return. And yet Donald Trump and his siblings were not done. Recycling the legally dubious techniques they had mastered with the GRATs, they dodged tens of millions of dollars in estate taxes on the remnants of empire that Fred Trump still owned when he died, The Times found. As with the GRATs, they obtained appraisals from Mr. Von Ancken that grossly understated the actual market value of those remnants. And as with the GRATs, they aggressively discounted Mr. Von Ancken’s appraisals. The result: They claimed that the five apartment complexes and two strip malls were worth $15 million. In 2004, records show, bankers would put a value of $176.2 million on the exact same properties. The most improbable of these valuations was for Tysens Park Apartments, a complex of eight buildings with 1,019 units on Staten Island. On the portion of the estate tax return where they were required to list Tysens Park’s value, the Trumps simplyleft a blank space and claimed they owed no estate taxes on it at all.Fred Trump’s estate tax returnRead document As with the Trump Village appraisal, the Trumps appear to have hidden key facts from the I.R.S. Tysens Park, like Trump Village, had operated for years under an affordable housing program that by law capped Fred Trump’s profits. This cap drastically reduced the property’s market value. Except for one thing: The Trumps had removed Tysens Park from the affordable housing program the year before Fred Trump died, The Times found. When Donald Trump and his siblings filed Fred Trump’s estate tax return, there were no limits on their profits. In fact, they had already begun raising rents. As their father’s executors, Donald, Maryanne and Robert were legally responsible for the accuracy of his estate tax return. They were obligated not only to give the I.R.S. a complete accounting of the value of his estate’s assets, but also to disclose all the taxable gifts he made during his lifetime, including, for example, the $15.5 million Trump Palace gift to Donald Trump and the millions of dollars he gave his children via All County’s padded invoices. “If they knew anything was wrong they could be in violation of tax law,” Mr. Tritt, the University of Florida law professor, said. “They can’t just stick their heads in the sand.” In addition to drastically understating the value of apartment complexes and shopping centers, Fred Trump’s estate tax return made no mention of either Trump Palace or All County. It wasn’t until after Fred Trump’s wife, Mary, died at 88 on Aug. 7, 2000, that the I.R.S. completed its audit of their combined estates. The audit concluded that their estates were worth $51.8 million, 23 percent more than Donald Trump and his siblings had claimed. That meant an additional $5.2 million in estate taxes. Even so, the Trumps’ tax bill was a fraction of what they would have owed had they reported the market value of what Fred and Mary Trump owned at the time of their deaths. Mr. Harder, the president’s lawyer, defended the tax returns filed by the Trumps. “The returns and tax positions that The Times now attacks were examined in real time by the relevant taxing authorities,” he said. “The taxing authorities requested a few minor adjustments, which were made, and then fully approved all of the tax filings. These matters have now been closed for more than a decade.” Donald Trump, in financial trouble again, pitched the idea of selling the still-profitable empire that his father had wanted to keepin the family. In 2003, the Trump siblings gathered at Trump Tower for one of their periodic updates on their inherited empire. As always, Robert Trump drove into Manhattan with several of his lieutenants. Donald Trump appeared with Allen H. Weisselberg, who had worked for Fred Trump for two decades before becoming his son’s chief financial officer. The sisters, Maryanne Trump Barry and Elizabeth Trump Grau, were there as well. The meeting followed the usual routine: a financial report, a rundown of operational issues and then the real business — distributing profits to each Trump. The task of handing out the checks fell to Steve Gurien, the empire’s finance chief. A moment later, Donald Trump abruptly changed the course of his family’s history: He said it was a good time to sell. Fred Trump’s empire, in fact, was continuing to produce healthy profits, and selling contradicted his stated wish to keep his legacy in the family. But Donald Trump insisted that the real estate market had peaked and that the time was right, according to a person familiar with the meeting. He was also, once again, in financial trouble. His Atlantic City casinos were veering toward another bankruptcy. His creditors would soon threaten to oust him unless he committed to invest $55 million of his own money. Yet if Donald Trump’s sudden push to sell stunned the room, it met with no apparent resistance from his siblings. He directed his brother to solicit private bids, saying he wanted the sale handled quickly and quietly. Donald Trump’s signature skill — drumming up publicity for the Trump brand — would sit this one out. Three potential bidders were given access to the finances of Fred Trump’s empire — 37 apartment complexes and several shopping centers. Ruby Schron, a major New York City landlord, quickly emerged as the favorite. In December 2003, Mr. Schron called Donald Trump and they came to an agreement; Mr. Schron paid $705.6 million for most of the empire, which included paying off the Trumps’ mortgages. A few remaining properties were sold to other buyers, bringing the total sales price to $737.9 million. On May 4, 2004, the Trump children spent most of the day signing away ownership of what their father had doggedly built over 70 years. The sale received little news coverage, and an article in The Staten Island Advance included the rarest of phrases: “Trump did not return a phone call seeking comment.” Even more extraordinary was this unreported fact: The banks financing Mr. Schron’s purchase valued Fred Trump’s empire at nearly $1 billion. In other words, Donald Trump, master dealmaker, sold his father’s empire for hundreds of millions less than it was worth. Within a year of the sale, Mr. Trump spent $149 million in cash on a rapid series of transactions that bolstered his billionaire bona fides. In June 2004 he agreed to pay $73 million to buy out his partner in the planned Trump International Hotel & Tower in Chicago. (“I’m just buying it with my own cash,” he told reporters.) He paid $55 million in cash to make peace with his casino creditors. Then he put up $21 million more in cash to help finance his purchase of Maison de l’Amitié, a waterfront mansion in Palm Beach, Fla., that he later sold to a Russian oligarch. ***** The first season of “The Apprentice” was broadcast in 2004, just as Donald Trump was wrapping up the sale of his father’s empire. The show’s opening montage — quick cuts of a glittering Trump casino, then Trump Tower, then a Trump helicopter mid-flight, then a limousine depositing the man himself at the steps of his jet, all set to the song “For the Love of Money” — is a reminder that the story of Donald Trump is fundamentally a story of money. Money is at the core of the brand Mr. Trump has so successfully sold to the world. Yet essential to that mythmaking has been keeping the truth of his money — how much of it he actually has, where and whom it came from — hidden or obscured. Across the decades, aided and abetted by less-than-aggressive journalism, Mr. Trump has made sure his financial history would be sensationalized far more than seen. Just this year, ina confessional essay for The Washington Post, Jonathan Greenberg, a former reporter for Forbes, described how Mr. Trump, identifying himself as John Barron, a spokesman for Donald Trump, repeatedly and flagrantly lied to get himself on the magazine’s first-ever list of wealthiest Americans in 1982. Because of Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his tax returns, the public has been left to interpret contradictory glimpses of his income offered up by anonymous leaks. A few pages from one tax return, mailed to The Times in September 2016, showed that hedeclared a staggering loss of $916 million in 1995. A couple of pages from another return, disclosed on Rachel Maddow’s program, showed that he earned an impressive $150 million in 2005. In a statement to The Times, the president’s spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, reiterated what Mr. Trump has always claimed about the evolution of his fortune: “The president’s father gave him an initial $1 million loan, which he paid back. President Trump used this money to build an incredibly successful company as well as net worth of over $10 billion, including owning some of the world’s greatest real estate.” Today, the chasm between that claim of being worth more than $10 billion and aBloombergestimateof $2.8 billion reflects the depth of uncertainty that remains about one of the most chronicled public figures in American history. Questions about newer money sources are rapidly accumulating because of the Russia investigation and lawsuits alleging that Mr. Trump is violating the Constitution by continuing to do business with foreign governments. But the more than 100,000 pages of records obtained during this investigation make it possible to sweep away decades of misinformation and arrive at a clear understanding about the original source of Mr. Trump’s wealth — his father. Here is what can be said with certainty: Had Mr. Trump done nothing but invest the money his father gave him in an index fund that tracks the Standard & Poor’s 500, he would be worth $1.96 billion today. As for that $1 million loan, Fred Trump actually lent him at least $60.7 million, or $140 million in today’s dollars, The Times found. And there is one more Fred Trump windfall coming Donald Trump’s way. Starrett City, the Brooklyn housing complex that the Trumps invested in back in the 1970s, sold this year for $905 million. Donald Trump’s share of the proceeds is expected to exceed $16 million, records show. It was an investment made with Fred Trump’s money and connections. But in Donald Trump’s version of his life, Starrett City is always and forever “one of the best investments I ever made.” Video productionSenior Producer:Gabriel J.X.

EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, North Carolina.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)  Good afternoon.  (Laughs.)  We’re going to do this.  (Applause.) Good afternoon.  Good afternoon.  It is — we- — (applause). Thank you. Okay.  All right.  Okay.  Okay.  (Laughs.)  We got some work to do.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)All right.  Oh, my goodness.  (Applause.) Are we going to do this North Carolina?  Yes.  (Applause.) It is so wonderful to be back in Charlotte.  I want to thank you all.  Can we give it up for Stacy for telling her incredible story?  (Applause.) And can we please thank that incredible Anthony Hamilton for his incredible performance?  (Applause.)  I love Anthony Hamilton. And it is so good — AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.) THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I love you back.  I love you back.  Thank you. And we have so many outstanding leaders here today, including my friend, Governor Roy Cooper, and your next — (applause) — and your next governor, Attorney General Josh Stein.  (Applause.) And here with us is your next attorney general, Congressman Jeff Jackson.  (Applause.)Mayor Lyles, my dear friend; the Council of State candidates; and all the leaders who are with us today, I thank you all — everyone — everyone here for taking the time and doing the work you are doing.  (Applause.)  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  (Applause.) All right.  So, here’s the thing.  Okay.  We got a lot of work to do.  We got a lot of work to do. Okay.  So, North Carolina, you probably know — and please have a seat, if you have a chair.  (Laughs.) Two nights ago, Donald Trump and I had our first debate.  (Applause.)  And I believe we owe it to the voters to have another debate — (applause) — because this election and what is at stake could not be more important. On Tuesday night, I talked about issues that I know matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America’s small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom — (applause) — and keeping — and keeping our nation safe and secure. But that’s not what we heard from Donald Trump. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Instead, it was the same old show, that same tired playbook that we’ve heard for years, with no plans for how he would address the needs of the American people — because you know it’s all about him, it’s not about you. Well, folks, I said it then; I say it now: It’s time to turn the page.  (Applause.)  Turn that page.  Turn that page.  B- — AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Turn the p- — (laughs). AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Because, to your point — to your point, America is ready for a new way forward.  (Applause.)  We are ready for a new generation of leadership that is optimistic about what we can do together. That is why Democrats, Republicans, and independents are supporting our campaign.  (Applause.)  Over 200 people who worked for President George H.W. Bush, President George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney have endorsed me for president.  (Applause.)  Former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congresswoman Liz Cheney are supporting me as well.  (Applause.)  Because, as they said, we have a duty as citizens to put country above partisanship and defend our Constitution.  (Applause.) And that is my pledge to you.  I will always put country above party, and I will be a president for all Americans.  (Applause.) And while Donald Trump is trying to pull our nation backward, we are fighting for the future — (applause) — a future with affordable childcare, paid leave, and affordable health care; a future where we build what I call an opportunity economy, so every American has an opportunity to own a home, to build wealth, to start a business.  (Applause.) And, you know, I — I talked about it the other night.  I love our small businesses.  I really do.  I love our small businesses.  My — my — and — and they’re — many of whom are here.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.) And — and the thing about our small businesses is — is they are — you know, my — so, first of all, my mother worked very hard.  And — and there was a lady who helped raise us, who was a second mother to us, Ms. Shelton, and she was a small business owner. And I grew up, then, understanding who our small business owners are.  They’re — they’re the — they’re leaders in the community.  They’re civic leaders.  They hire locally.  They mentor.  They’re part of the fabric of the community.  And — and I know they are the backbone of America’s economy.  (Applause.) So, my plan is to give a $50,000 tax deduction to start up small businesses.  (Applause.)  Because, you know, not everybody started out with 40 — $400 million on a silver platter and then filed for bankruptcy six times. But a whole lot of people have the ingenuity, the entrepreneurship, the work ethic, and the ambition to do that kind of work and just need to be seen and supported for what they are and what they do for all of us.  (Applause.)  An opportunity economy.We need to build more housing in America. (Applause.)  And so, we are going to cut red tape and work with the private sector to build 3 million new homes by the end of my first term.  (Applause.) I have a plan to lower the cost of living for America’s families on everything from health care to groceries.  Under my plan, more than 100 million Americans will get a tax break, and thousands of dollars of your hard-earned money will go back into your pockets, including $6,000 during the first year of a child’s life.  (Applause.) And I will always put middle-class and working families first.  I grew up a middle-class kid.  (Applause.)  I was raised by a hardworking mother, who saved up, and by the time I was a teenager, she was able to afford to buy our first home.  I understand how people work hard and have dreams and aspirations for their children and need to be put first, understanding, again, when the middle class is strong, America is strong.  (Applause.)  America is strong. But Donald Trump, well, he has a different plan. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Just google — just google “Project 2025.” AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  It is a detailed and dangerous blueprint for what he will do if he is elected president. Donald Trump will give billionaires and big corporations massive tax cuts and cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars —AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — even as they pull in record profits.He will add more than $5 trillion to the national debt. He intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And he wants to impose what is, in effect, a national sales tax.  I call it a “Trump sales tax,” because it will be a tax on everyday basic necessities, which the economists have measured will cost the average family nearly $4,000 more a year. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And — and the top economists, they’ve previewed our plans.  They’ve reviewed them.  Goldman Sachs says my plan would grow our economy and his plan would shrink it.  (Applause.)  Sixteen — sixteen Nobel Prize-winning economists say he would reignite inflation, and Moody’s says he would ignite a recession by the middle of next year. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  You know, he talks a big talk, but when folks review the numbers — highly respected folks — that’s what you learn about him.  That’s what you learn. And North Carolina, on top of all of this, Donald Trump intends to end the Affordable Care Act. AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And as Stacy mentioned, you heard what he said in the debate.  He — he has no plan to replace it.  (Laughter.)  He said — (laughs) — he said “concepts of a plan.”  (Laughs.)Oh, you all watched the debate.  (Laughs.)  (Applause.)“Concepts.”  “Concepts.”  No actual plan.  “Concepts.”  (Laughter.) And understand what’s at stake on that: 45 million Americans are insured through the Affordable Care Act, and he’s going to end it based on a concept — (laughter) — and take us back to when insurance companies have the power to deny people with preexisting conditions. Well, we are not going back.AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!   We’re not going back!  We’re not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughs.)  We’re not going back.  We’re — AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!   We’re not going back!  We’re not going back! THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’re not going back.  No. We will move forward.  We will move forward, because ours is a fight for the future and it is a fight for freedom — (applause) — like the fundamental freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.  (Applause.) And we know how we got to this issue, because Donald Trump handpicked three members of the United States Supreme Court — AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended.  And now in over 20 states in our nation, they have what I call “Trump abortion bans,” including North Carolina — AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — and every single state in the South except Virginia.  Think about that: every single state in the south except Virginia. Now one in three women in America lives under a Trump abortion ban, many with no exceptions even for rape and incest.  It is immoral.  It is immoral. And I know we all here understand and agree: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.  (Applause.) And what we know is that the i- — the impact of this is — you know, it’s been over two years now since that decision came down.  The impact of this is so real.  It’s affecting people every day just based on the stories we know, and there are so many stories we don’t know.  Think about it. Because of Trump’s abortion bans, women are being refused care during miscarriages.  Some are only being treated if they develop sepsis. And when asked on Tuesday night, Donald Trump refused to say that he would veto a national abortion ban.  You remember that?  He refused to answer that question.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Refused to answer that question.Well, I’mma tell you, when Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom, as president of the United States, I will proudly, proudly sign it into law.  (Applause.)  Proudly.And across our nation — across our nation, we are witnessing a full-on assault on other hard-fought, hard-won fundamental freedoms and rights, like the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water, and the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride.  (Applause.)And North Carolina has a history of the point I’m about to make.  Generations — generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands.  It is in our hands.  (Applause.)So, we who believe in the sacred freedom to vote will finally pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.  (Applause.)  And we who believe in the freedom to live safe from gun violence will finally pass an assault weapons ban, universal background checks, and red flag laws.  (Applause.)So much — so much is at stake in this election.  So much is at stake in this election.  And understand this is not 2016 or 2020 for a number of reasons, including why the stakes are higher.  Because two months ago, the United States Supreme Court basically told the former president that he will effectively be immune no matter what he does in the White House.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Think about that.  Think about that.  Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right?  He — he who has vowed that if reelected, he will be a dictator on day one; that he will weaponize the Department of Justice against his political enemies; and has called for the, quote, “termination” of the Constitution of the United States of America.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Think about that.  And let us be very clear: Somebody who suggests we should terminate the Constitution of the United States should never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States.  (Applause.)  Never again.  Never again.  Never again. And you know one of the points that I mentioned on Tuesday — so, let — the people who served under him at the White House, who saw him every day — right? — his national security advisor, his Defense secretary, his chief of staff, and his vice president all have warned — all, who worked with him every day in the White House, sat with him in the Oval Office — have warned America Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States and should never again occupy our nation’s highest office.  (Applause.)So, North —AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And we’re not going back.AUDIENCE:  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!  We’re not going back!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  We’re not going back.  So — so, it comes down to this.  It comes down to this.  We are here together because we love our country.  (Applause.)  We love our country.  And we understand the awesome — the awesome responsibility that comes with the greatest privilege on Earth: the privilege and pride of being an American.  (Applause.)AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right.AUDIENCE:  USA!  USA!  USA!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  That’s right.  That’s right.  Right.And so, I believe it is the highest form, then, of patriotism to fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America.  (Applause.)So, North Carolina, we have 54 days until Election Day — (applause) — 54 days — and just 35 days — just 35 days until early voting begins.  (Applause.) And it’s not only the presidency that’s on the ballot. There are many important races, including Josh Stein running for governor — (applause) — that’s right — whose opponent was handpicked by Donald Trump and wants a ban — a total ban on abortion in this state.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Right.So, these are the stakes in this election, up and down the ballot — up and down the ballot.  But we know the power is with the people.  (Applause.)  The power is with the people.  And your voice is your vote, North Carolina.  (Applause.)  Your vote is your voice.And we know — here’s the thing, also.  We’re all — we’ve got — we are just — we are loving our campaign, aren’t we?  We are loving this campaign.  (Applause.)  We’re having a good time.  We’re having a good time.  I know that. But here’s also the thing.  Ours will be a very tight race until the end.  Okay?  It’s going to be a tight race until the end, and we are the underdog.  Understand that.  We are the underdog.There are powerful forces trying to convince people that their vote doesn’t matter.AUDIENCE MEMBERS:  We love you!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  There are powerful forces here too.  (Laughs.)But I say all that to say we’ve got some hard work ahead of us.  But here’s the thing I love about everybody here: We love hard work.  Hard work is good work.  Hard work is good work.  Hard work is good work.  (Applause.)And with your help, we will win in November.  We will win.  We will.  (Applause.)  We will win.So, North Carolina, today, I then ask you: Are you ready to make your voices heard?  (Applause.)Do we believe in freedom?AUDIENCE:  Yes!  (Applause.)THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Do we believe in opportunity? AUDIENCE:  Yes!  (Applause.)THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Do we believe in the promise of America?AUDIENCE:  Yes!  (Applause.)THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And are we ready to fight for it?AUDIENCE:  Yes!  (Applause.)THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And when we fight —AUDIENCE:  We win!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — we win.God Bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)END            4:12 P.M.

Trump has distanced himself from Project 2025, and he has not advocated this policy — much less the one Harris described.",

                "title": "Trump claims not to know who is behind Project 2025. A CNN review found at least 140 people who worked for him are involved | CNN Politics",
                "text_body": "Donald Trumphas lately made clear he wants little to do with Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for the next Republican president that has attracted considerable blowback in his race for the White House. “I have no idea who is behind it,” the former president recently claimed on social media. Many people Trump knows quite well are behind it. Six of his former Cabinet secretaries helped write or collaborated on the 900-page playbook for a second Trump term published by the Heritage Foundation. Four individuals Trump nominated as ambassadors were also involved, along with several enforcers of his controversial immigration crackdown. And about 20 pages are credited to his first deputy chief of staff. In fact, at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in Project 2025, a CNN review found, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership,” the project’s extensive manifesto for overhauling the executive branch. Dozens more who staffed Trump’s government hold positions with conservative groups advising Project 2025, including his former chief of staff Mark Meadows and longtime adviser Stephen Miller. These groups also include several lawyers deeply involved in Trump’s attempts to remain in power, such as his impeachment attorney Jay Sekulow and two of the legal architects of his failed bid to overturn the 2020 presidential election, Cleta Mitchell and John Eastman. To quantify the scope of the involvement from Trump’s orbit, CNN reviewed online biographies, LinkedIn profiles and news clippings for more than 1,000 people listed on published directories for the 110 organizations on Project 2025’s advisory board, as well as the 200-plus names credited with working on “Mandate for Leadership.” Overall, CNN found nearly 240 people with ties to both Project 2025 and to Trump, covering nearly every aspect of his time in politics and the White House – from day-to-day foot soldiers in Washington to the highest levels of his government. The number is likely higher because many individuals’ online résumés were not available. In addition to people who worked directly for Trump, others who participated in Project 2025 were appointed by the former president to independent positions. For instance, Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr authored an entire chapter of proposed changes to his agency, and Lisa Correnti, an anti-abortion advocate Trump appointed as a delegate to the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, is among the contributors. Several people involved in Project 2025 didn’t serve in the Trump administration but were influential in shaping his first term. One example is former US Attorney Brett Tolman, a leading force behind the former president’s criminal justice reform law who laterhelped arrange a pardon for Charles Kushner, the father of Trump’s son-in-law. Tolman is listed as a contributor to “Mandate for Leadership.” The extensive overlap between Project 2025 and Trump’s universe of allies, advisers and former staff complicates his efforts to distance himself from the work. Trump’s campaign has sought for months to make clear that Project 2025 doesn’t speak for them amid an intensifying push by President Joe Biden and Democrats to tie the Republican standard bearer to the playbook’s more controversial policies. In a statement to CNN, campaign spokeswoman Danielle Alvarez said Trump only endorses the Republican Party platform and the agenda posted on the former president’s website. “Team Biden and the (Democratic National Committee) are lying and fear-mongering because they have nothing else to offer the American people,” Alvarez said. Behind Project 2025 is the Heritage Foundation, a 51-year-old conservative organization that aligned itself with Trump not long after his 2016 victory. Heritage is led by Kevin Roberts, a Trump ally whom the former president praised as “doing an unbelievable job” on a February night when they shared the same stage. Heritage conceived Project 2025 to begin planning so a Republican president could hit the ground running after the election. One of its priorities is creating a roadmap for the first 180 days of the new administration to quickly reorient every federal agency around its conservative vision. Described on its website as “a movement-wide effort guided by the conservative cause to address and reform the failings of big government and an undemocratic administrative state,” Project 2025 also aims to recruit and train thousands of people loyal to the conservative movement to fill federal government positions. One organization advising Project 2025, American Accountability Foundation, is also putting together a roster of current federal workers it suspects could impede Trump’s plans for a second term. Heritage ispaying the group $100,000 for its work. Many of Project 2025’s priorities are aligned with the former president, especially on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracies. Both Trump and Project 2025 have called for eliminating the Department of Education. But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn’t explicitly backed. Within “Mandate for Leadership” are plans toban pornography,reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, exclude the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, make it harder for transgender adults to transition, and eliminate the federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service. Its voluminous and detailed plans also run counter to Trump’s desire fora streamlined GOP platformabsent any language that Democrats could wield against Republicans this cycle. Roberts recently faced backlash as well for saying in an interview that the country was “in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.” Three days later, Trump posted to Truth Social: “I know nothing about Project 2025.” “I disagree with some of the things they’re saying and some of the things they’re saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal,” he wrote. In response to Trump’s social media post, a Project 2025 spokesperson told CNN in a statement it “does not speak for any candidate or campaign.” “It is ultimately up to that president, who we believe will be President Trump, to decide which recommendations to use,” the spokesperson said. Trump’s campaign has repeatedly said in recent months that “reports about personnel and policies that are specific to a second Trump Administration are purely speculative and theoretical” and don’t represent the former president’s plans. Project 2025 and similar policy proposals coming from outside Trump’s campaign are “merely suggestions,” campaign managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita wrote in a statement. However, Trump’s attempts to distance himself from Project 2025 have already encountered credibility challenges. The person overseeing Project 2025, Paul Dans, was a top official in Trump’s White House who has previously said he hopes to work for his former boss again. Shortly after Trump’s Truth Social post last week, Democrats noted a recruitment video for Project 2025 features a Trump campaign spokeswoman. On Tuesday, the Biden campaign posted dozens of examples of connections between Trump and Project 2025. CNN’s review of Project 2025’s contributors also demonstrated the breadth of Trump’s reach through the upper ranks of the vast network of organizations working to move the country in a conservative direction – from women’s groups and Christian colleges to conservative think tanks in Texas, Alabama and Mississippi. New organizations centered around Trump’s political movement, his conspiracy theories around his electoral defeats and his first-term policies are deeply involved in Project 2025 as well. One of the advisory groups, America First Legal, was started by Miller, a key player in forming Trump’s immigration agenda. Another is the Center for Renewing America, founded by Russ Vought, former acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, who wrote for Project 2025 a detailed blueprint for consolidating executive power. Vought recently oversaw the Republican Party committee that drafted the new platform heavily influenced by Trump. In addition to Vought, two other former Trump Cabinet secretaries wrote chapters for “Mandate for Leadership”: Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson and acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller. Three more former department heads – National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe, acting Transportation Secretary Steven Bradbury and acting Labor Secretary Patrick Pizzella – are listed as contributors. Project 2025’s proposals for reforming the country’s immigration laws appear heavily influenced by those who helped execute Trump’s early enforcement measures. Former acting US Customs and Border Protection chiefMark Morganand former Immigration and Customs Enforcement chiefTom Homan– the faces of Trump’s polarizing policies – contributed to the project, as did Kathy Nuebel Kovarik,one of the policy advisers pushing to end certain immigrant protections behind the scenes. The Project 2025 chapter on overhauling the Department of Homeland Security was written by Ken Cuccinelli, a top official at the department under Trump. Some of Trump’s most contentious and high-profile hires are credited with working on “Mandate for Leadership,” including some whose tenures ended under a cloud of controversy. Before Trump adviser Peter Navarro went to prison for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena as part of the House investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, he wrote a section defending the former president’s trade policies and advocating for punitive tariffs. Other contributors include: Michael Pack, a conservative filmmaker who orchestrated a mass firing at the US Agency for Global Media after he was installed by Trump; Frank Wuco, a senior White House adviser who oncepromoted far-right conspiracieson his talk radio show, including lies about President Barack Obama’s citizenship; former NOAA official David Legates, a notable climate change skepticinvestigated for posting dubious research with the White House imprint; and Mari Stull, a wine blogger-turned-lobbyist who left the Trump administrationamid accusations she was hunting for disloyal State Department employees. The culmination of their work, spread across 900 pages, touches every corner of the executive branch and would drastically change the federal government as well as everyday life for many Americans. In summarizing the undertaking, Roberts wrote in “Mandate for Leadership” that Project 2025 represented “the next conservative President’s last opportunity to save our republic.” “Conservatives have just two years and one shot to get this right,” Roberts said. “With enemies at home and abroad, there is no margin for error. Time is running short. If we fail, the fight for the very idea of America may be lost.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

The Inflation Reduction Act is a transformative law that is helping the United States meet its climate goals and strengthen energy security, investing in America to create good-paying jobs, reducing energy and health care costs for families, and making the tax code fairer.Just twelve months after the law was signed, it is already having a significant impact on American workers and families, and is delivering for underserved communities and those that have been too often left behind. Outside groups estimate the Inflation Reduction Act’s clean energy and climate provisions havecreated more than 170,000 clean energy jobsalready, companies have announced over $110 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments in the last year alone, the law is delivering billions of dollars to protect communities from the impacts of climate change, and millions of seniors are saving money because their insulin is capped at $35 per month.Today, to mark the anniversary of the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris Administration is releasing a new feature onInvest.govthat highlights stories of how the Inflation Reduction Act and Bidenomics are making a difference for Americans in all 50 states and U.S. territories. Bidenomics is the President’s vision for growing the economy from the middle out and bottom up, including by investing in America, creating good-paying union jobs, and lowering cost for American families.In the 12 months since the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law: LARGEST CLIMATE INVESTMENT IN HISTORYThe Inflation Reduction Act is the most ambitious investment in combating the climate crisis in world history.Today, the Department of Energy (DOE) released anupdated studyaffirming the transformative climate progress driven by the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. DOE estimates that the two laws will cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by up to 41 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.Together with additional actions being taken by federal, state, and local governments as well as the private sector, the United States is now on a path to achieve President Biden’s ambitious goal of cutting emissions 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. This is consistent with external researchers, who project that U.S. greenhouse gas emissions will fall43-48 percentbelow 2005 levels by 2035 thanks to laws already on the books.The Inflation Reduction Act is accelerating progress to meet America’s climate goals, build a clean energy economy, and strengthen energy security: In addition to building America’s clean energy future, the Inflation Reduction Act will strengthen the resilience of communities across the country and protect them from dangerous and disastrous impacts of the climate crisis. INVESTING IN AMERICA TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBSThe Inflation Reduction Act aims to boost domestic manufacturing, create good-paying union jobs, and build more resilient, secure, and trusted supply chains. Together with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the CHIPS and Science Act, the lawhas helped spur over $500 billion in private sector manufacturing investmentssince President Biden and Vice President Harris took office, including approximately $240 billion in clean energy manufacturing investments. The law is driving investment to places too often left out and left behind through bonus tax credits for building clean energy projects in traditionalenergy communitiesandlow-income communities, and is creating good-paying and union jobs through incentives for usingdomestic contentand payingprevailing wages and hiring registered apprenticesto build America’s clean energy future.In just the twelve months since the Inflation Reduction Act became law: LOWERING ENERGY COSTSDOEestimatesthat the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will cut electricity rates by as much as 9 percent and lower gas prices by as much as 13 percent by 2030—putting tens of billions of dollars back in the pockets of Americans.Because of the historic investments driven by the Inflation Reduction Act that are building a clean energy economy and leading to greater access to clean power, Americans across the country are already seeing savings on their home energy costs. For example: DOE launched anEnergy Savings Hubto help consumers, renters, and homeowners find ways to save money on their energy bills by tapping into the programs in the Inflation Reduction Act. Already: In addition, the Biden-Harris Administration is awarding grants to states and other entities to help consumers save money on their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient. DOE hasopened applicationsfor states to implement $8.5 billion in home energy rebate programs, which will provide rebates for low- and middle-income families to buy and install cost-saving electric appliances and to make energy efficiency improvements to their homes. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)announced$837 million in grant and subsidy funding and $4 billion in loan commitment authority through theGreen and Resilient Retrofit Program, which will improve the energy and water efficiency and climate resilience of HUD-assisted multifamily properties serving low-income residents.LOWERING HEALTH CARE COSTSThe Inflation Reduction Act advances President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Congressional Democrats’ longstanding commitment to making health care more affordable for American families and seniors. The law is bringing down health care costs and thanks to President Biden, Vice President Harris, and the Inflation Reduction Act’s continuation of important improvements on the Affordable Care Act, the nation’s uninsured rate has reached an historic low, and nearly 15 million people are saving an average of $800 per year on their insurance premiums. In addition: MAKING THE WEALTHY AND BIG CORPORATIONS PAY THEIR FAIR SHAREThe Inflation Reduction Act raises $300 billion over a decade by requiring large corporations to pay a 15 percent minimum tax on their profits and by enacting a 1 percent excise tax on stock buybacks and redemptions. The Treasury and the IRS have already issuedinitialguidanceon these tax provisions, which go into effect this year.The Inflation Reduction Act also makes a historic investment in modernizing the IRS, providing funding to hire more staff and upgrade critical technology infrastructure. Thanks to these investments, the IRS has already: Over the next decade, these investments will enable the IRS to collect at least $150 billion in taxes already owed by wealthy people and big corporations.Going forward, the IRS is on track to implement additional improvements for customer service, including a direct-file pilot for a free, voluntary, IRS-run electronic filing system beginning in 2024; additional in-person services in rural and underserved areas; a processing initiative that will expedite refunds by several weeks; and new online account tools and mobile-friendly tax forms. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 One year ago, the Supreme Court eliminated a constitutional right that it had previously recognized, overturning nearly fifty years of precedent. Today, more than 23 million women of reproductive age—one in three—live in one of the 18 states with an abortion ban currently in effect. In the last year, women have been denied essential medical care to preserve their health and even save their lives. They have been turned away from emergency rooms, forced to delay care, and made to travel hundreds of miles and across state lines for needed medical care. Despite this devastating impact on women’s health, Republican elected officials continue to advance these bans at both the state and national level. President Biden and Vice President Harris stand with the majority of Americans who believe the right to choose is fundamental—and who have made their voices heard at every opportunity since the Supreme Court’s decision inDobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.As the President has made clear since the day of theDobbsdecision, the only way to ensure women in every state have access to abortion is for Congress to pass a law restoring the protections ofRoe v. Wade. While we continue to call on Congress to restore these protections, the Administration has taken executive action to protect access across the full spectrum of reproductive health care. In the wake ofDobbs, the President issued two Executive Orders directing a comprehensive slate of actions to protect access to reproductive health care services, including abortion. And today,the President is issuing a third Executive Order focused on strengthening access to affordable, high-quality contraception, a critical aspect of reproductive health care. The Administration remains fully committed to implementing these Executive Orders and advancing access to reproductive health care through the leadership of the interagency Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access, co-chaired by the White House Gender Policy Council and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Today, the Biden-Harris Administration is providing an update on the work of the Task Force on Reproductive Healthcare Access and the Administration’s ongoing efforts to defend reproductive rights.

CSTAUDIENCE:  MVP!  MVP!  MVP!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  (Laughter.)  Thank you, all.  (Applause.)Oh, it’s good to be back in Wisconsin.  Good afternoon, everyone.  Good afternoon.Can we please give it up for Dr. Domeyer-Klenske for just all she has done — (applause) — and her incredible courage?  I had the joy of spending some time with her backstage.  You really are fantastic.And, of course, it is good to be with my dear friend Tammy Baldwin.  She was here earlier today, but she had to go back to Washington for some important votes.  So —AUDIENCE:  MVP!  MVP!  MVP!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  And on the subject of Tammy Baldwin, I — I want to just mention Tammy because she had to go back to Washington for some important votes.  She was here earlier.  But I will say, Wisconsin, that you have in her an extraordinary leader.  I had the privilege of spending time with her when I was in the Senate.  Tammy is always fighting for the people of Wisconsin.  And so, can we please applaud her for what she does?  (Applause.)  Thank you.And moving on, I want to say that, you know, when we look at where we are as a country, we do no- — need those elected leaders.  Among the leaders who are here — for example, Congresswoman Gwen Moore is here, another member of Congress — (applause) — and all of the state and local leaders who are here, I want to thank you all for the work that you do to uphold one of our nation’s highest ideals: the ideal of freedom.Freedom, I believe, is fundamental to the promise of America — freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom of assembly, the freedom to vote.  In America, freedom is not to be given.  It is not to be bestowed.  It is ours by right — (applause) — by right.And that includes the freedom to make decisions about one’s own body — (applause) — not the government telling you what to do.Fifty-one years ago today, in the case of Roe v. Wade, the United States Supreme Court recognized the fundamental constitutional right to reproductive freedom.  And for nearly half a century, Americans relied on the freedoms protected by Roe.  However, 19 months ago, the highest court in our land, the court of Thurgood and RBG, took a constitutional right from the people of America, from the women of America.And now on the 51st anniversary of Roe, we speak of it in the past tense.  In the last 19 months, in states across our nation, extremists have proposed and passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women; laws that threaten doctors and nurses with prison time, even for life, simply for providing healthcare; laws that, in some states, make no exception, even for rape and incest.Now, many of you know, I started my career as a prosecutor specializing in crimes against women and children.  What you may not know is one of the reasons why.  So, when I was in high school, I learned that one of my best friends was being molested by her stepfather.  And so, I said to her, “You’ve got to come stay with us.”  I called my mother, and my mother said, “Of course she should,” and she did.So, the idea that someone who survives a crime that is violence to their body, a violation to their body, and then would not have the authority to decide what happens to their body next, that’s immoral.  It’s immoral.  (Applause.)And let us all agree, one does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling her what to do with her body.  (Applause.)  If she chooses, she will consult her pastor, her priest, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling her what to do.This is, in fact, a healthcare crisis.  And there is nothing about this that is hypothetical.  Today, in America, one in three women of reproductive age live in a state with an abortion ban — one in three.And let us understand what that really means for people across our nation.  Let us understand the horrific reality that women are facing every single day since Roe was overturned.  I have met women who have had miscarriages in toilets because they were refused care.  I met a woman who went to the emergency room during a miscarriage and was turned away because the doctors were afraid they’d be thrown in jail for giving care.  And it was only when she developed sepsis that they gave her the care she needed.We know that the majority of women who have abortions are mothers.  If they live in a state with an abortion ban and they need to travel to receive care, God help her if she does not have paid leave or affordable childcare.  God help them if they don’t have the savings to buy a bus, a train, or a plane ticket or to bo- — book a hotel room.And while these extremists say they are motivated by the health and well-being of women and children, in reality, they ignore the crisis of maternal mortality.  (Applause.)  The top 10 states with the highest rates of maternal mortality all have abortion bans.  The hypocrisy abounds.And let us be clear about what they’re up to.  These extremists want to roll back the clock to a time before women were treated as full citizens — Wisconsin to the 1800s.  Just look at what happened here in this beautiful state of Wisconsin.After Roe was dismantled, extremists evoked a law from 1849 to stop abortion in this state — 1849 — before women could vote, before women could hold elected office, before many women could even own property.In a state whose motto is “Forward” — (applause) — these extremists are trying to take us backwards.  But we’re not having that.  We’re not having that.  (Applause.)And just look at what the fallout has been: the reproductive care clinics across the state that had to close, the women that hospitals had to turn away — women like Meagan.So, Meagan learned she was pregnant early last year.  A few months later, she and her husband, Jon, went to their doctor for a routine ultrasound, and it revealed devastating news for them.  The fetus had a severe genetic disorder, and Meagan’s pregnancy threatened her life.  But because of that 1849 law, Meagan’s doctor could not provide a lifesaving abortion unless he found two other physicians to sign off.He called doctor after doctor here in Wisconsin, but none were willing to risk going to prison.  Ultimately, Meagan had to go to Minnesota to receive care.  She had to leave the state where she calls home to save her life.Thankfully, late last year, a judge declared that this 1849 law did not apply to abortion, and some clinics in Wisconsin have since reopened.  But that does not undo — (applause) — that does not undo or heal the incredible pain that women like Meagan have endured.Meagan and her husband, Jon, are here with us today.  And in front of all the friends, let us applaud them for their courage, and I thank them for the time that I had with them today.  Can we please applaud them?  (Applause.)And I — I mention them because I think it’s very important to understand the courage it takes to share those kinds of stories.  And the reality of what is happening in real time across our country is that, for every story we hear, there are so many that we do not hear about.Today, an untold number of women are silently suffering — women who are being subjected to profound judgment; women who are being made to feel as though they did something wrong, as though they should be embarrassed, being made to feel as though they are alone.And to those women, I say: We see you, and we are listening, and we see your incredible strength.  And we are here with you.  (Applause.)And so, as we face this crisis, as we are clear-eyed about the harm, let us also understand who is responsible, shall we?   The former President —AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  — hand-picked three Supreme Court Justices because he intended for them to overturn Roe. He intended for them to take your freedoms. And it is a decision he brags about.A couple of weeks ago, he said that, for years, quote, “They were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated.”  But he said, quote, “I did it.  And I’m proud to have done it.”AUDIENCE:  Booo —AUDIENCE MEMBER:  (Inaudible.)THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Proud?  Proud?Proud that women across our nation are suffering?  Proud that women have been robbed of a fundamental freedom?  Proud that doctors could be thrown in prison for caring for their patients?  That young women today have fewer rights than their mothers and grandmothers?How dare he.  (Applause.)And the extremists are not done.  This afternoon, in the Wisconsin Legislature, extremists will hold a hearing on a new bill that would ban abortion in this state with no exception for rape and incest.And in the United States Congress, extremists are trying to pass a national abortion ban to outlaw abortion in every single state.But what they need to know is that if Congress passes a national abortion ban, President Joe Biden will veto it.  (Applause.)  Yes, he will.Because here’s the deal about all of us: We trust women.  (Applause.)  We trust women to make decisions about their own bodies.  We trust women to know what is in their own best interest.  And women trust us to fight to protect their most fundamental freedoms.  (Applause.)And it is going to take all of us.  It is going to take all of us.Joe Biden and I are fighting in court to protect women’s access to medication and emergency care.  We strengthened the patient privacy protections so that medical records stay between a woman and her doctor.  And we are protecting the right of women to travel for abortion care.But the bottom line is: To truly protect reproductive freedoms, we must restore the protections of Roe.Because, you see, what the United States Supreme Court took, Congress can put back in place.  (Applause.)So, we need a majority of leaders in Congress who simply agree — here’s the thing — simply agree that the government should not be making those personal decisions for folks.And when Congress passes a law that puts back the protections of Roe, Joe Biden will sign it.  (Applause.)So, I’ll close with this.  It’s going to take all of us to get us to that place — everybody here.And momentum is on our side.  (Applause.)  We are winning.Since Roe was overturned, every time reproductive freedom has been on the ballot, the people of America have voted for freedom.  From Kansas to California to Kentucky; in Michigan, Montana, Vermont, and Ohio; the people of America have voted for freedom.   And not by a little — by overwhelming margins.  (Applause.)Proving, also, this is not a partisan issue.  Tens of millions of Americans in red states and blue, including here in Wisconsin, marched to the polls in defense of fundamental freedoms.So, I say: The voice of the people has been heard, and it will be heard.And then I finally ask: Today, Wisconsin, are you ready to make your voices heard?  (Applause.)Do we trust women?  (Applause.)Do we believe in reproductive freedom?  (Applause.)Do we believe in the promise of America?  (Applause.)And are we ready to fight for it?  (Applause.)And when we fight, we win.God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  (Applause.)END                  1:10 P.M.

The Biden campaign is betting big on abortion rights as a major driver in the 2024 presidential election. But the economy, foreign policy, immigration and inflation are also major issues for voters, as Biden tries to boost his low poll numbers. (AP Photo/Joe Maiorana, File) Follow AP’s coverage of thepresidential election. WASHINGTON (AP) — When Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump said recently that he was “proud” to have a hand in overturning the abortion protections enshrined in Roe v. Wade, Democratic pollster Celinda Lake took it as a political gift, thinking to herself, “Oh my God, we just won the election.” It may not be that simple, but as the 2024 race heats up, President Joe Biden’s campaign is betting big on abortion rights as a major driver for Democrats in the election. Republicans are still trying to figure out how to talk about the issue, if at all, and avoid a political backlash. “A vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris is a vote to restore Roe, and a vote for Donald Trump is a vote to ban abortion across the country,” said Julie Chavez Rodriguez, Biden’s campaign manager. “These are the stakes in 2024.” Since Roe was overturned in 2022, voters have pushed back by approving a number of statewide ballot initiatives to preserve or expand the right to abortion.Support for abortion rightsdrove women to the polls during the 2022 midterm elections, delivering Democrats unexpected success. For many people, the issue took on higher meaning, part of an overarching concern about thefuture of democracy, according to AP VoteCast, a nationwide survey of more than 94,000 voters in the midterm elections. Democrats have since worked to broaden how they talk to voters about theSupreme Court’s decision, delivered by a conservative majority that included three justices nominated by Trump, and what it means for people’s access to health care and their personal freedoms.  The Biden campaign is launchinga nationwide political push this coming weekcentered on Monday’s 51st anniversary of the 1973 decision that codified abortion rights. Vice President Kamala Harris, the administration’s chief messenger on this, will hold the first event Monday in Wisconsin. On Tuesday, Biden, Harris, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff head to Virginia for a campaign stop focused on the issue. More events featuring top Democrats in battleground states are also in the works. The campaign on Sunday released a advertising campaign scheduled to run all week, including during “The Bachelor” season premiere and the NFL conference championships. The spot features Dr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Texas who had to leave her state to get an abortion when she learned that her baby had a fatal condition called anencephaly. “In Texas, you are forced to carry that pregnancy, and that is because of Donald Trump overturning Roe v. Wade,” she said. Focusing on abortion will not be a silver bullet for Democrats. Theeconomy, foreign policy, immigrationand inflation are major issues, too, as is concern about Biden’s age as he tries to overcomelow poll numbers.Many voters are simply turned off by the prospect of a likely2024 Trump-Biden rematch. What to know about the 2024 election Still, Democrats believe abortion will be a key motivator for base voters and help expand their coalition. Biden aides and allies point to recent elections that have overwhelmingly shown that, when voters can choose, they have chosen to safeguard abortion rights. The issue isn’t vanishing from the headlines anytime soon, either.The Supreme Court will decidewhether to restrict access to medication prescribed for abortion and to treat other reproductive issues. And there is an ongoing stream of stories about the impact of abortion bans, such as the mother who had to sue,then flee, her home state to end her doomed pregnancy. What to know about the 2024 election: News outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us.Donate to the AP. Democrats spent decades trying to calibrate their message, always defending the right to choose while also making overtures to voters who are conflicted about the issue. President Bill Clinton’s mantra was that abortion should be “safe, legal and rare.” But the loss of federal abortion protections has been a catalyst for a broader and bolder message about abortion and reproductive rights after the historic setback from the decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization that overturned Roe. “We know that if we talk about this issue as a fundamental freedom, we are able to resonate across demographics — older voters, younger voters, people of color, folks in rural areas,” said Mini Timmaraju, head of Reproductive Freedom for All, formerly NARAL Pro-Choice America. Biden aides said the strategy is to let the president be who he is — an 81-year-old Catholic man who doesn’tuse the wordabortion much, preferring to talk instead about the issue in the context of personal freedom. The White House often frames the fight as part of a larger battle that involves book bans, voting rights and other social issues. For more aggressive talk about abortion and how the ripple effects of the decision are affecting maternal health, there’s Harris. Timmaraju said those “different messages resonate with different parts of the electorate.” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat and vocal advocate for abortion rights, said it would be good if Biden spoke more forcefully on the topic. “I think people want to know that this is a president that is fighting,” Whitmer told CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday. “To use maybe more ... blunt language, maybe that would be helpful.” Since the high court overturned Roe,roughly 25 million women now live in stateswith some type of ban in effect. The impacts are increasingly felt by women who never intended to end their pregnancies, yet have had emergency medical caredenied or delayed because of the new restrictions. According to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll,among Democrats, nearly nine in 10 say abortion should generally be legal. Four in 10 say it should be legal in all cases, and nearly half say it should be legal in most cases. As for Republicans, the topic was largely absent in the lead-up to this year’s Iowa caucuses, a remarkable change in a state that haslong backed religious conservativesvowing to restrict the procedure. Part of the change is because Republicans achieved a generational goal with the overturning of Roe. But it also underscores a fear among Republican candidates and voters alike that vocalizing their desire to further restrict abortion rights might be politically dangerous. “I am calling the time period we are in now ‘the new fight for life,’” said Benjamin Watson, a former NFL player who is now an anti-abortion advocate. “Roe is done, but we still live in a culture that knows not how to care for life. Roe is done, but the factors that drive women to seek abortions are ever apparent and ever increasing.” Overall, opinions on abortion remain complex, with most people believing it should be allowed in some circumstances and not in others. About two-thirds of U.S. adults say abortion should generally be legal, but only about one-quarter say it should always be legal and only about 1 in 10 say it should always be illegal. Trump has waffled on the topic.During a recent Fox News town hall, he expressed support for limited exceptions and criticized state laws that ban abortion after six weeks. But he also has promoted his own role. “For 54 years they were trying to get Roe v. Wade terminated, and I did it and I’m proud to have done it,” he said. The Biden administration isnearing the limitsof what it can do to preserve access to abortion absent congressional legislation. In the immediate aftermath June 24, 2022 Supreme Court decision, the administration quickly tried to flex its regulatory muscle to fight back against Republican efforts to severely restrict abortion.Many efforts have been challenged in court. Biden had invited states with robust abortion access to apply for Medicaid waivers that would help pay for women to travel for the care. But so far, only California has applied to unlock federal money for the effort. The top U.S. health official, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, is on a three-day East Coast tour to talk with doctors and medical students about access to abortion and birth control. “This is the beginning of an effort to reach out to all Americans,” Becerra said, and “say to the American people how important it is that we stand up at a crucial time.” Associated Press writers Alanna Durkin Richer in Boston and Amanda Seitz and Linley Sanders contributed to this report.

Twenty-five million women of childbearing age now live instates where the law makes abortions harder to getthan they were before the ruling. Decisions about the law are largely in the hands of state lawmakers and courts. Most Republican-led states have restricted abortion. Fourteen ban abortion in most cases at any point in pregnancy. Twenty Democratic-leaning states have protected access to abortion. Here’s a look at what’s changed since the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization ruling. Last summer, as women and medical providersbegan to navigatea landscape without legal protection for abortion, Nancy Davis’ doctors advised her to terminate her pregnancy. The fetus she was carrying had no skull and was expected to die soon after birth. But doctors in Louisiana, where Davis lived, would not provide the abortion due to a new law banning it throughout pregnancy in most cases. Davis became one of the women whose stories, told on news sites and network news, in newspapers and blogs,illustrated the shifting grounddoctors and their patients tried to navigate. At the same time, abortion opponents who worked for decades to abolish a practice they see as murder cheered the Supreme Court’s Dobbs ruling. Anti-abortion groups saidthe 1973 Roe v. Wade rulingthat legalized abortion nationwide was undemocratic because it prevented states from enacting bans.  “The Dobbs decision was a democratic victory for life that generations fought for,” said E.V. Osment, a spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, a major anti-abortion group. While some states scrambled to pass new restrictions, others already had enacted laws that were designed to take effect if the court overturned Roe. More than 25 million women ages 15 to 44, or about 2 in 5 nationally, now live in states where there are more restrictions on abortion access than there were before Dobbs. More than 5.5 million more live in states where restrictions have been adopted but are on hold pending court challenges. Bans on abortion no later than 12 weeks into pregnancy are on the books in nearly every state in the Southeast — though some are not in effect. Many laws that make exceptions for medical emergencies do not clearly define those situations. After Davis went public with her challenges last year,Louisiana lawmakers debatedwhether doctors in the state were right to deny her an abortion under a law that has exceptions for “medically futile” pregnancies and when there’s a substantial risk of death or impairment for the woman. But the Legislature made no changes to clarify the law. Davis is among a number of women who ended up traveling out of state to have a legal surgical abortion. She got help from a fund that raises money for women to travel for such purposes. With her fiancé by her side, Davis flew to New York in September, when she was about four months pregnant. The whole experience was heartbreaking, she said. “A mother’s love starts as soon as she knows she’s pregnant. That attachment starts instantly,” she said. “It was days I couldn’t sleep. It was days I couldn’t eat.” As some states restricted abortion, others locked in access. Clinics moved across state lines, added staff and lengthened hours to accommodate women leaving their home states to end their pregnancies. In 25 states, abortion remains generally legal up to at least 24 weeks of pregnancy. In 20 of those states, protections have been solidified through constitutional amendments or laws. Officials in many of those states, includingCalifornia,Colorado,Minnesota,New MexicoandNew York, have explicitly invited women from places where the procedure is banned. Women have flocked to states with legal access. CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health had for decades treated patients in Memphis, Tennessee, some seeking abortions. After Tennessee’s abortion ban kicked in last year, the clinic opened a second outpost that’s about a three-hour drive away, in Carbondale, Illinois, a state that has positioned itself asan oasis for abortion access. “I would say 80% or more of our patients continue to come from the communities that CHOICES has always taken care of,” said CEO Jennifer Pepper, who said the Illinois clinic sees on average 350 patients a month. “They’re coming from Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas and even Texas, but now they’re having to travel much farther.” Kansas is one of the closest places to obtain abortions for people in parts of Missouri, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas. A new clinic opened in Kansas City, Kansas, four days before Dobbs. Within weeks, the clinic was overwhelmed. Even after lengthening hours, hiring staff and flying in physicians, it’s been able to take only about 10% to 15% of people who have sought an abortion there. Dr. Iman Alsaden, the Planned Parenthood medical director based in Kansas, said most patients in the Kansas clinics are now coming from elsewhere. “You’re in a really, really dire public health situation when you are looking at someone who had to jump through endless amounts of hoops just to make this work and saying they’re so lucky they’re able to do this,” Alsaden said. In anticipation of out-of-state patients, states such as Hawaii have passed laws to allow more health care workers, such as nurse practitioners, to provide abortions. In New Jersey, officials late last year announced a grant to train more medical professionals to perform the procedures. Because of reporting lags and gaps in data, the impact on the number of abortions provided across the U.S. is not completely clear. But the authors of #WeCount, a survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning, a nonprofit organization that promotes research and supports abortion access, say the monthly average went down after Dobbs. The group’s data finds that the number of abortions provided through clinics, hospitals and other providers in states where bans were put in place plummeted to nearly zero. The tracking effort collects monthly data, providing a snapshot of abortion trends after Roe v. Wade was overturned. It does not reflect self-managed abortions, relies on estimates in places where providers do not supply data and does not fully account for seasonal differences in pregnancies or abortions. Still, it’s the fullest national picture available for now. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data covering 2022 is not likely to be released until late 2024. Even then, the picture won’t be completely clear: Not every state collects abortion data, and what is collected does not include self-managed abortions provided outside clinics, hospitals and doctor’s offices. In Louisiana, where abortion was legal until 22 weeks’ gestational age before Dobbs, the state reported more than 7,400 abortions in 2020, the last year for which full data was available. #WeCount found there were an average of 785 a month in April and May 2022 — and fewer than 10 every month since the ban there has been in place. There are similar trends elsewhere. InIdaho,1,700 abortions were reported in 2020, and #WeCount found fewer than 10 a month recently.In Texas,state data shows only a handful of abortions monthly from August through January. Before restrictions there took effect in 2021, there were often more than 5,000 per month. The #WeCount survey of abortion providers has found that the overall average number of abortions at clinics and hospitals was lower in the months after the Dobbs ruling, from July 2022 through March but that the number of abortions has risen dramatically in states that border those with no access, such as Illinois, Kansas, New Mexico and North Carolina. In Illinois, for instance, the survey tallied about 5,600 abortions in April 2022 and more than 7,900 in March 2023. Even before the court ruled, most abortions in the U.S. were done througha two-pill regimen, not a surgical procedure. Now groups are using medication to provide access — however illegal -- in states where abortion is banned. For example, Aid Access works with doctors overseas and in states with shield laws, which are intended to bar abortion-related investigations by other states. Those doctors prescribe the medications and Aid Access ships them. It saw requests in a sample of 30 states more than double from before a draft of the Dobbs ruling was leaked last year until it became official and bans started taking effect. The group’s Netherlands-based founder and director, Rebecca Gomperts, believes most U.S. women who want abortions are still managing to get them. “The fact that the abortion pill is available,” she said, “that makes the tragic of it much less profound.” Still, she said, those who struggle the most for access are poor and Black women. The move from surgical to medication abortion has frustrated abortion opponents, who have taken their case to court. Some abortion opponents are calling for the abortion drug mifepristone to lose its 23-year-old approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. TheSupreme Courthas preserved access for now. One ripple from overturning Roe in conservative states has been a new willingness to adopt measures such as improving foster care and benefits for postpartum women. Mississippi,where the Dobbs case originated,is a key example. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed off on several proposals that he deemed as the “next phase” of the “pro-life agenda.” This included expanding a tax credit from $3.5 million a year to $10 million a year for people or businesses who donate to anti-abortion centers, which provide diapers, clothing and other assistance for pregnant women and have been accused ofproviding misleading informationto steer women away from abortion. He also approved creating an income tax credit of up to $10,000 for adopting a child who lives in Mississippi and $5,000 for a adopting a child from outside the state. He also agreed to extend Medicaid health insurance coverage for lower-income women until a year after they give birth, rather than just two months. The state’s two Catholic bishops sent a letter to lawmakers and Reeves in February calling for the Medicaid expansion. “This they felt was consistent with the intent of Dobbs,” Jackson Bishop Joseph Kopacz said in an interview, “saying that it can’t stop at birth.” For Shannon Bagley, the executive director of the Center for Pregnancy Choices, an anti-abortion center just outside Jackson that will benefit from the expanded tax credit, said it’s offering more parenting classes and focusing on helping eligible women sign up for Medicaid, job search assistance and offering donated car seats, cribs and other baby items. “This is a new era and we’re going to have to be more and we’re going to have to do more,” she said. In conservative Utah, a ban on abortions throughout pregnancy took effect almost immediately after the Dobbs ruling. But the next day, the state’s Planned Parenthood affiliate challenged the law, saying it violated the state constitution. A judge put the ban on hold while the case works its way through the courts. It’s one of more than 50 lawsuits filed on abortion policy since the Dobbs ruling. Lawsuits have been the foundation of the abortion debate for decades, but now the burden is on abortion-rights advocates to prove that restrictions are too harsh, rather than on anti-abortion groups to prove they are justified. Many challenges rely on arguments about the rights topersonal autonomyorreligious freedom. A Texas lawsuit alleges women were denied abortions even whentheir lives were at risk. Bans or restrictions are on hold in at least six states while judges sort out their long-term fate. The only states where a top court has permanently rejected restrictions since the Dobbs ruling areIowaandSouth Carolina. In the latter, lawmakers later adopted a new ban, butenforcement is on holddue to a court challenge. In Utah, lawmakers this year passed a first-in-the-nation law banning abortion clinics. But ajudge put enforcement of that on hold, too, while the court case plays out. There’s little evidence that doctors, women, or those who help them get abortions are being prosecuted. In Mississippi, the state attorney general’s office says no charges have been brought under a new law that calls for up to 10 years in prison for anyone who provides or attempts to provide an abortion in cases where it wasn’t to save the woman’s life or to end a pregnancy caused by rape or incest. Progressiveprosecutors across the country, including in states with bans, have said that they would not pursue abortion-related cases, or that they would make them a low priority. One in Florida wassuspended from his jobfor it by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. James Bopp Jr., general counsel to the National Right to Life committee, finds it troubling that prosecutors would not pursue abortion cases. He said it’s a change from the era before Roe v. Wade, when most states restricted abortion. “They were going to enforce the laws; there was no question they were going to do that,” Bopp said. “That was their obligation.” Legislative efforts to classify abortion as homicide or murder in South Carolina,KentuckyandLouisianaalso have sputtered. “The question about punishing the pregnant person is going to become the existential question in the anti-abortion movement,” said Greer Donley, an abortion law expert and associate professor at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. But Bopp said prominent anti-abortion groups like his oppose such measures. He said women who pursue abortions are “victims of the abortion culture, victims of men, particularly wealthy men.” The political table has been reset, with Republicans entering a new election season weighing how to balancethe interests of a basethat wants the strictest bans possible against the desires of the broader electorate. Polling has consistently found that most Americans think abortions should be available in at least some circumstances, including early in a pregnancy, but that most also favor restrictions later in a pregnancy. Polling from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found that the majority opposed banning abortion in the first six weeks of pregnancy, but most also favor barring abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy. Only six states have no limit, and abortion is rare after 21 weeks. Last year, voters sided with abortion-rights advocates inall six stateswith abortion-related ballot measures, including in generally conservative Kansas and Kentucky. The issue was also a major factor in whyDemocrats performed better than expectedin 2022 elections. There are pushes for ballot measures to protect abortion access in several states, includingOhio. InIndiana,South CarolinaandWest Virginia— all states that have adopted bans since Dobbs — the legislative battles were not between Democrats and Republican over whether to impose restrictions but among Republicans on just how far to go. Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America believes the issue could be a boost for conservatives with the right framing. The group announced this year that it’sworking with Kellyanne Conway, a former Trump adviser, to “get pro-life candidates on offense in the 2024 election cycle.” Among advocates on the left, a lot of alarm bells rang overJustice Clarence Thomas’ concurring opinionin Dobbs. “We should reconsider all of this Court’s substantive due process precedents,” including cases that found married people have the right to obtain contraceptives, people can engage in private, consensual sex acts and the right to same-sex marriage, Thomas wrote. So far, measures on those areas have not gained traction. State legislation on contraceptives has aimed only to guarantee or protect access to it, and President Joe Biden last year signeda law to safeguard same-sex marriage. Instead, Republican lawmakers in many states focused in 2023 onrestricting gender-affirming care, especially for transgender minors.

(AP Photo)                                 KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — Two suicide bombers and gunmen attacked crowds of Afghans flocking to Kabul’s airport Thursday, transforming a scene of desperation into one of horror in the waning days of an airlift for those fleeing the Taliban takeover. The attacks killed at least 60 Afghans and 13 U.S. troops, Afghan and U.S. officials said. The U.S. general overseeing the evacuation said the attacks would not stop the United States from evacuating Americans and others, and flights out were continuing. Gen. Frank McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command, said there was a large amount of security at the airport, and alternate routes were being used to get evacuees in. About 5,000 people were awaiting flights on the airfield, McKenzie said. The blasts came hours after Western officials warned of a major attack, urging people to leave the airport. But that advice went largely unheeded by Afghans desperate to escape the country in the last few days of an American-led evacuation before the U.S. officially ends its 20-year presence on Aug. 31. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the killings on its Amaq news channel. The IS affiliate in Afghanistan is far more radical than the Taliban, who recently took control of the country in a lightning blitz. The Taliban were not believed to have been involved in the attacks and condemned the blasts. In an emotional speech from the White House, U.S. President Joe Biden said the latest bloodshed would not drive the U.S. out of Afghanistan earlier than scheduled, and that he had instructed the U.S. military to develop plans to strike IS.  “We will not forgive. We will not forget. We will hunt you down and make you pay,” Biden said. U.S. officials initially said 11 Marines and one Navy medic were among those who died. Another service member died hours later. Eighteen service members were wounded and officials warned the toll could grow. More than 140 Afghans were wounded, an Afghan official said. One of the bombers struck people standing knee-deep in a wastewater canal under the sweltering sun, throwing bodies into the fetid water. Those who moments earlier had hoped to get on flights out could be seen carrying the wounded to ambulances in a daze, their own clothes darkened with blood. Emergency, an Italian charity that operates hospitals in Afghanistan, said it had received at least 60 patients wounded in the airport attack, in addition to 10 who were dead when they arrived. “Surgeons will be working into the night,” said Marco Puntin, the charity’s manager in Afghanistan. The wounded overflowed the triage zone into the physiotherapy area and more beds were being added, he said. The Afghan official who confirmed the overall Afghan toll spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief media. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said one explosion was near an airport entrance and another was a short distance away by a hotel. McKenzie said clearly some failure at the airport allowed a suicide bomber to get so close to the gate. He said the Taliban has been screening people outside the gates, though there was no indication that the Taliban deliberately allowed Thursday’s attacks to happen. He said the U.S. has asked Taliban commanders to tighten security around the airport’s perimeter. Adam Khan was waiting nearby when he saw the first explosion outside what’s known as the Abbey gate. He said several people appeared to have been killed or wounded, including some who were maimed. The second blast was at or near Baron Hotel, where many people, including Afghans, Britons and Americans, were told to gather in recent days before heading to the airport for evacuation. Additional explosions could be heard later, but Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said some blasts were carried out by U.S. forces to destroy their equipment. A former Royal Marine who runs an animal shelter in Afghanistan says he and his staff were caught up in the aftermath of the blast near the airport. “All of a sudden we heard gunshots and our vehicle was targeted, had our driver not turned around he would have been shot in the head by a man with an AK-47,” Paul “Pen” Farthing told Britain’s Press Association news agency. Farthing is trying to get staff of his Nowzad charity out of Afghanistan, along with the group’s rescued animals. He is among thousands trying to flee. Over the last week, the airport has been the scene of some of the most searing images of the chaotic end of America’s longest war and the Taliban’s takeover, as flight after flight took off carrying those who fear a return to the militants’ brutal rule. When the Taliban were last in power, they confined women largely to their home and widely imposed draconian restrictions. Already, some countries have ended their evacuations and begun to withdraw their soldiers and diplomats, signaling the beginning of the end of one of history’s largest airlifts. The Taliban have insisted foreign troops must be out byAmerica’s self-imposed deadline of Aug. 31— and the evacuations must end then, too.   Even so, the airlift continued Thursday, though the number of evacuees fell for a second day as the terror attack and further threats kept people away.. From 3 a.m. to 3 p.m., Washington time, about 7,500 people were evacuated, a White House official said. Fourteen U..S. military flights carried about 5,100, and 39 coalition flights carried 2,400. The total compared to 19,000 in one 24-hour period toward the start of the week. In Washington, Biden spent much of the morning in the secure White House Situation Room where he was briefed on the explosions and conferred with his national security team and commanders on the ground in Kabul. Overnight, warnings emerged from Western capitals about a threat from IS, which has seen its ranks boosted by the Taliban’s freeing of prisoners during its advance through Afghanistan. Shortly before the attack, the acting U.S. ambassador to Kabul, Ross Wilson, said the security threat at the Kabul airport overnight was “clearly regarded as credible, as imminent, as compelling.” But in an interview with ABC News, he would not give details. Late Wednesday, the U.S. Embassy warned citizens at three airport gates to leave immediately due to an unspecified security threat. Australia, Britain and New Zealand also advised their citizens Thursday not to go to the airport. Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied that any attack was imminent at the airport, where the group’s fighters have deployed and occasionally used heavy-handed tactics to control the crowds. After the attack, he appeared to shirk blame, noting the airport is controlled by U.S. troops. Before the blast, the Taliban sprayed a water cannon at those gathered at one airport gate to try to drive the crowd away, as someone launched tear gas canisters elsewhere. Nadia Sadat, a 27-year-old Afghan, carried her 2-year-old daughter with her outside the airport. She and her husband, who had worked with coalition forces, missed a call from a number they believed was the State Department and were trying to get into the airport without any luck. Her husband had pressed ahead in the crowd to try to get them inside. “We have to find a way to evacuate because our lives are in danger,” Sadat said. “My husband received several threatening messages from unknown sources. We have no chance except escaping.” Aman Karimi, 50, escorted his daughter and her family to the airport, fearful the Taliban would target her because of her husband’s work with NATO. “The Taliban have already begun seeking those who have worked with NATO,” he said. “They are looking for them house-by-house at night.” The Sunni extremists of IS, with links to the group’s more well-known affiliate in Syria and Iraq, have carried out a series of brutal attacks, mainly targeting Afghanistan’s Shiite Muslim minority, including a2020 assault on a maternity hospitalin Kabul in which they killed women and infants. The Taliban have fought against Islamic State militants in Afghanistan, where the Taliban have wrested back control nearly 20 years after they were ousted in a U.S.-led invasion. The Americans went in following the 9/11 attacks, which al-Qaida orchestrated while being sheltered by the group. Amid the warnings and the pending American withdrawal, Canada ended its evacuations, and European nations halted or prepared to stop their own operations. The Taliban have said they’ll allow Afghans to leave via commercial flights after the deadline next week, but it remains unclear which airlines would return to an airport controlled by the militants. Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said talks were underway between his country and the Taliban about allowing Turkish civilian experts to help run the facility.

Two Navy SEALs died during the mission. (U.S. Department of Justice via AP, File)       RICHMOND, Va. (AP) — Two Navy SEALs drowned last month while trying to board a vessel that was intercepted by U.S. naval forces in the Arabian Sea. On Thursday, federal prosecutors unsealed a criminal complaint against four foreign nationals they say weretransporting suspected Iranian-made missile componentson the vessel. The four sailors were later taken to Virginia where they were criminally charged. Material witness warrants were filed against another 10 crew members. In an affidavit supporting the criminal complaint, an FBI agent wrote that the sailors admitted they had departed from Iran after at least one of the them initially claimed they left from Pakistan. All four sailors had Pakistani identifications cards. Prosecutors said they were smuggling missile components for the type of weapons used by Houthi rebel forces in recent weeks. Here’s a look at the case and what comes next: On the night of Jan. 11, U.S. Central Command Navy forces, including Navy SEALs, along with members of the U.S. Coast Guard Maritime Safety and Security Team, boarded an unflagged vessel described as a dhow in international waters of the Arabian Sea, off the coast of Somalia. U.S. officials have said that whileboarding the boat, Navy Special Warfare Operator 1st Class Christopher J. Chambers slipped into the gap created by high waves between the vessel and the SEALs’ combatant craft. As Chambers fell, Navy Special Warfare Operator 2nd Class Nathan Gage Ingram jumped in to try to save him, according to U.S. officials familiar with what happened. Both men werelost at sea. Efforts to find and rescue them were unsuccessful.  During a search of the ship, U.S. forces found and seized what an FBI official described as Iranian-made advanced conventional weaponry, including critical parts for medium-range ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles, a warhead, and propulsion and guidance components. The FBI affidavit said the type of weaponry found on the vessel is consistent with weaponry used by Houthi rebel forces in recent attacks on merchant ships and U.S. military ships in the region. Navy forces were conducting an “authorized flag verification” when they boarded the vessel in international waters. U.S. authorities can board a ship to verify if it has the authority to fly its flag or to determine the nationality of a vessel without a flag. Any country has a right under international law to board vessels and check for documentation of its nationality. In this case, U.S. forces determined the vessel was violating international law by not having any flag in international waters. That made it a “vessel without nationality” subject to U.S. jurisdiction, the FBI affidavit states. Navy forces ultimately determined the dhow was unsafe and unseaworthy and sunk the vessel “according to protocol,” the FBI agent wrote. All 14 sailors on the vessel were brought onto the USS Lewis B. Puller and were later taken to Virginia. Martin Davies, director of the Maritime Law Center at Tulane University Law School, said flag verifications are more common in drug investigations because ships smuggling drugs often conceal any signs of identification. “It’s clearly permitted under international law,” Davies told The Associated Press. “Any country would have the authority to do this.” Some countries may not like the U.S. “throwing its weight around in another part of the world,” Davis noted. “But that’s a political thing, not a legal thing,” he said. The other 10 crew members are being detained under the federal material witness law. It allows courts to issue warrants for the arrest and detention of a person if their testimony is “material in a criminal proceeding,” and if it “may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.” The law attracted attention and sparked controversy when it was used in international terrorism investigations after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Defense lawyers have criticized the law because it can result in people being detained for lengthy periods even though they are not charged with or suspected of committing a crime. A 2014 report by the Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General identified 112 cases in which material witnesses were detained from 2000 until 2012. The median period of time those witnesses were detained was 26 days. All four sailors are being held in custody pending preliminary and detention hearings scheduled for Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Richmond. A judge will determine whether to detain the defendants without bail as they await trial. Muhammad Pahlawan is charged with attempting to smuggle advanced missile component and providing false information to U.S. Coast Guard officers during the boarding of the vessel. Pahlawan’s co-defendants — Mohammad Mazhar, Ghufran Ullah and Izhar Muhammad — were charged with providing false information. Melissa O’Boyle, Ullah’s attorney, and Charles Gavin, Muhammad’s attorney, declined to comment on the charges. Attorneys for the other two defendants did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment Friday. Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland. Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

                "text_body": "Advertisement Officials said the dead were three Army Reserve soldiers from Georgia, part of an engineering company trained for deployment at short notice. ByDave Philipps The Department of Defense on Monday identified three Army Reserve soldiers who were killed at a U.S. base in Jordan on Sunday in what the Biden administration said was a drone attack from an Iran-backed militia. The department said at least 34 other service members were wounded in the attack. Those killed were Sgt. William Jerome Rivers, 46, of Carrollton, Ga.; Specialist Kennedy Ladon Sanders, 24, of Waycross, Ga.; and Specialist Breonna Alexsondria Moffett, 23, of Savannah, Ga. The soldiers, two of them women, were assigned to the 718th Engineer Company, based at Fort Moore, Ga. — a team of soldiers trained to deploy at short notice to build roads, landing fields and protective earthen berms for U.S. forces. “On behalf of the Army Reserve, I share in the sorrow felt by their friends, family and loved ones,” said the chief of the Army Reserve, Lt. Gen. Jody Daniels. “Their service and sacrifice will not be forgotten, and we are committed to supporting those left behind in the wake of this tragedy.” In Jordan, the three were assigned to a remote desert logistics outpost, called Tower 22, in the northeastern part of the country, where the borders of Syria, Iraq and Jordan converge. The small installation hosts about 350 U.S. Army and Air Force troops, according to the Pentagon’s Central Command. U.S. troops have long used Jordan, strategically located near Iraq, Israel, the Palestinian territory of the West Bank, Saudi Arabia and Syria, as a launch point for operations. About 3,000 American troops are typically stationed in the country. The three who were killed on Sunday are part of an often overlooked part of the military that delivers supplies, maintains buildings, builds roads and does other routine work while shouldering the risk of operating in hostile territory. Sergeant Rivers was trained as an electrician, had served in the Army Reserve for more than a decade and had been deployed to Iraq in 2018 during the fight against Islamic State militants, according to Army records. Specialist Sanders and Specialist Moffett both enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2019 and were trained to operate heavy equipment, such as road graders. Tower 22 was Specialist Moffett’s first deployment. Specialist Sanders had been deployed once before, in 2021, to an American outpost in Djibouti. Families of the soldiers expressed their grief in social media posts that were widely shared by friends and relatives. “This is one of the saddest days of my life,” Specialist Moffett’s mother said in aFacebook postSunday. “The pain will never go away and my life is forever changed. I will never get to cook your favorite food, we will never get to talk on the phone and I will never see you walk through my front door again.” The small community of Waycross, Ga.,issued a proclamationon Monday honoring Specialist Sanders. “Kennedy Sanders exemplified the highest ideals of honor, duty, and selflessness,” it reads. “Her sacrifice reminds us of the profound debt of gratitude we owe to those who selflessly serve our country.” Dave Philipps writes about war, the military and veterans and covers The Pentagon.More about Dave Philipps Trump’s Immigration Raids:Five years ago, the raids upended life for immigrant families in poultry towns, butthe industry still runs on their work.

Aired 9-10p ET Aired October 23, 2024 - 21:00   ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. [21:00:35]ANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: Good evening.Only 13 days to go in one of the most momentous and unusual presidential races in American history. Tonight, Kamala Harris faces voters in the biggest battleground prize, Pennsylvania.CNN's presidential town hall begins right now.And welcome. We are live from Chester Township, Pennsylvania, Delaware County, one of the critical counties around Philadelphia that will help determine who wins the White House.Welcome to CNN's presidential town hall with the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris. I'm Anderson Cooper.Now, in this room, we have assembled a group of 32 Pennsylvania voters who say they are still undecided or persuadable. All of them are registered to vote. Some cast votes for Joe Biden in 2020, others for Donald Trump. Some didn't vote at all. And, for some, this is their first election.Many are leaning right now to one candidate or another, but they all say they have yet to make their final choice.Now, we found these voters working with a nonpartisan research firm, as well as business and religious groups, universities, and other civic organizations. These voters are asking their own questions tonight selected by CNN to cover a variety of topics.You may see them holding a piece of paper when they're asking their question. It has their question it. That is a question they have come up with. It has not been edited in any way by CNN.We also invited former President Donald Trump to participate in a town hall or debate. He declined.Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Vice President Kamala Harris.(APPLAUSE)COOPER: Madam Vice President, thank you. Appreciate it. Thanks.You have a mic right here.KAMALA HARRIS, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES (D) AND U.S. PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Thank you.COOPER: Thank you so much.HARRIS: Good evening, everyone. Good evening.COOPER: Thanks so much for being with us.We're going to get to the audience in just a second.I want to start by asking you, though. For weeks, you have been calling Donald Trump unstable, unhinged. You have called him dangerous. You have quoted General Milley recently, who called him a fascist. Today, you quoted General Kelly, who said that Trump repeatedly praised Hitler.HARRIS: Yes.COOPER: But there are tens of millions of Americans right now who have heard all those things, and they don't buy it, or, even if they do, they're still going to vote for Donald Trump.He's arguably more popular now than ever. You have 13 days to go. What do you say to those voters to convince them, because some of them are in this room?HARRIS: Sure.And I thank you all for taking the time to be here. And you could be doing a number of other things with your time. So this really is proof that we love our country. People are engaged, Anderson, and really want to talk about the issues.And so the issue that you raise, yes, I do believe that Donald Trump is unstable, increasingly unstable, and unfit to serve.And I don't necessarily think that everyone has heard what you and I have heard repeatedly, which is, the people who know Donald Trump best, the people who worked with him in the White House, in the Situation Room, in the Oval Office, all Republicans, by the way, who served in his administration, his former chief of staff, his national security adviser, former secretaries of defense, and his vice president, have all called him unfit and dangerous.They have said explicitly he has contempt for the Constitution of the United States. They have said he should never again serve as president of the United States. We know that is why Mike Pence is not running with him again, why the job was empty.And then, today, we learned that John Kelly, a four-star Marine general, who was his longest-serving chief of staff, gave an interview recently in the last two weeks of this election talking about how dangerous Donald Trump is.And I think one has to think about, why would someone who served with him, who is not political, a four-star Marine general, why is he telling the American people now? And, frankly, I think of it as, he's just putting out a 911 call tothe American people. Understand what could happen if Donald Trump were back in the White House. And, this time, we must take very seriously, those folks who knew him best and who were career people are not going to be there to hold him back.[21:05:00]At least, before, there were folks who we know what he would say, but they would restrain him. Imagine now, Donald Trump in the Oval Office, in the Situation Room, he who has openly admired dictators, said he would be a dictator on day one. The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has said he is a fascist to the core.So I think that when the American people reflect, especially those who are undecided, on who you should listen to, don't take my word for it. In fact, go online and listen to John Kelly, his voice, talking about what he thinks of Donald Trump two weeks before the election. Because I think we all know, to your point, Anderson, it is close, but there are undecided voters who clearly, by being here, have an open mind, want to talk in a way that is grounded in issues and fact.And when they hear these facts, I think it compels a lot of people to be concerned about the future of our country with Donald Trump at the lead.COOPER: You've quoted General Milley calling Donald Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?HARRIS: Yes, I do. Yes, I do. And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.Again, look at their careers. These are not people, with the exception, I think, of only Mike Pence. These were not politicians. These are career people who have served in the highest roles in national security, who have served as generals in our military, who are highly respected, talking about the person who would be commander- in-chief, not to mention what we know and what they've told us about how he talks about the military, servicemen and women, referring to them as suckers and losers. How he demeans people who have taken an oath to sacrifice their life for our country.And I do believe, Anderson, that part of this is why, even just this week, I traveled this state and others with Liz Cheney, former Congress member who was a very high-ranking Republican. She has endorsed me. Her father, the former Vice President of the United States, Dick Cheney, is voting for me. Over 400 members of -- previous members of the administration from Ronald Reagan to both Presidents Bush to Donald Trump even have endorsed my candidacy.And the reason why, among them, is a legitimate fear, based on Donald Trump's words and actions, that he will not obey an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. He himself has said he would terminate the Constitution of the United States and wants to earn your vote to stand again behind the seal of the President of the United States. No one standing behind the seal of the President of the United States of America should be in that position saying they want to terminate the Constitution of the United States.COOPER: Let's get to some of our voters. This is a -- I want you to meet a registered Republican who's very concerned about Trump's views on democracy and January 6th. She told us she's looking for a reason to vote for you but has yet to make her final decision.Her name is Natasha Kwiatkowski. She's a student at Bryn Mawr College. What's your question, Natasha?NATASHA KWIATKOWSKI, STUDENT AT BRYN MAWR COLLEGE: Awesome. Thank you for being here and thank you for taking my question.HARRIS: Thank you, Natasha.KWIATKOWSKI: And as someone who hasn't fully committed to either party, how do you plan to address the concerns of independent voters and anti-Trump Republicans like myself who feel left out of the political landscape? And what specific actions would you take to bridge the political divide and create more unity?HARRIS: That's a wonderful question. I pledge to you to be a president for all Americans. And I think to the point in the spirit of your question that people are frankly exhausted with what has been happening over the several years, which is this environment that is suggesting that Americans should be pointing fingers at one another, that we are divided as a nation, instead of what I think you and I will speak for us, I think, who believe and know the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us.And I think that the American people deserve to have a president who is grounded in what is common sense, what is practical, and what is in the best interest of the people, not themselves.I started my career as a prosecutor. And I will tell you, I never in my career -- and most of my career was outside of Washington, D.C., by the way.[21:10:02]HARRIS: Only four years, when I was in the Senate, were in Washington, other than being vice president.I have never, in my career as a prosecutor, asked a victim or a witness of a crime, \"Are you a Democrat or a Republican?\" The only thing I have ever asked is, \"Are you OK?\"And I do believe that is what the American people deserve in their president, and not someone who makes decisions based on who voted for them or what is in their personal interest. And I reference that because, as we know, it has been revealed that Donald Trump, when he was president, during extreme disasters, when it came time to determine how those areas, those people who had been traumatized by extreme weather, would get relief, he asked the question, did they vote for him? I believe the American people deserve better. And they deserve a president who is focused on solutions, not sitting in the Oval Office plotting their revenge and retribution.COOPER: Let me introduce you to Erik Svendsen. He runs a service desk for an IT company in Conshohocken, Pennsylvania. He's registered as a Libertarian, describes himself as an independent. He says he's undecided.Eric?ERIC SVENDSEN, IT MANAGER: Thank you, Anderson. Thank you both for being here.HARRIS: Thank you, Eric.SVENDSEN: So my question is concerning groceries.HARRIS: Yeah.SVENDSEN: Grocery prices have gone up quite a bit in the last four years. And some people blame former President Trump. Some people blame President Biden. Who would you say is correct and what would you do to bring prices down for Americans?HARRIS: Thank you, Eric. And you're absolutely right. You know it. I know it. I think most Americans know it. The price of groceries is still too high. And we need to address it, in a number of ways.One of my aspects of doing what we need to do to bring down the cost of living for working people and the middle class in America is to address the issue of grocery prices. Part of my background and how I come to it is probably a new approach grounded in a lot of my experiences as a former attorney general, where I took on price gouging.And part of my plan is to create a new approach, that is the first time that we will have a national ban on price gouging, which is companies taking advantage of the desperation and need of the American consumer and jacking up prices without any consequence or accountability.So that is one way. But to your point, Eric, there -- you know, there are a number of issues that we need to address in terms of bringing down the cost of living. It includes what we need is, really, a new approach that I bring to the issue of affordable housing, including, for example, rent.And again, I bring to it my experience, knowing what has been happening in terms of how corporations have been buying up blocks of property to diminish competition, and then rents get jacked up, and addressing that, both in terms of making sure that there is a consequence and accountability for that, but also investing in people's dreams of home ownership, you know, knowing that, for too long, frankly, both administrations -- I mean, both the administrations in both parties, Democrats and Republicans, haven't done enough to deal with the issue of housing.And we need a new approach that includes working with the private sector. I say that as a -- as a devout public servant, working with the private sector to cut through the red tape, working with home builders, working with developers to create tax incentives so that we can create more housing supply and bring down the price.COOPER: Let -- let me just ask you about price gouging. I looked at your plan. You talk about going after price gougers -- and I'm quoting from the plan -- on essential goods during emergencies or times of crisis.I get that. How does that help, though, someone like Eric, with prices that, for years, the grocery price has just been high?HARRIS: Well, first of all, Anderson, as you know, and, obviously, CNN has been covering extensively what has been happening in the state of Georgia, North Carolina, Florida. It's a real issue. I -- I was attorney general of California. I was the top law enforcement officer of the biggest state in the country.I took this issue on because it affects a lot of people. And I'm not going to apologize for the fact that we need to actually deal with accountability when these -- not all, in fact most don't, but when companies are taking advantage of the desperation and the need of the American people -- we saw it, actually during the pandemic as well, where, because of supply chain issues, there was a reduction of supply, and then they would inflate the price of everyday necessities, not to mention, by the way, again, Donald Trump should be here tonight to talk with you and answer your questions. He's not. He refused to come.But understand that part of his plan is to put in place a national sales tax of at least 20 percent on everyday goods and necessities. And that, by economist estimates, independent economists, would cost you, as the American consumer and taxpayer, an additional $4,000 a year.[21:15:04]COOPER: I want you to meet Carol Nackenoff, a political science professor at Swarthmore College. She's a registered Democrat who said she's leaning toward voting for you, has yet to make her final decision.Carol?HARRIS: Hi, Carol. Thank you.CAROL NACKENOFF, POLITICAL SCIENCE PROFESSOR AT SWARTHMORE COLLEGE: Good evening. Thank you for visiting us in Delaware County, Vice President Harris.My question is this: if you could accomplish only one major policy goal that required congressional action, what would it be, and why?HARRIS: Well, there's not just one. I have to be honest with you, Carol. There's a lot of work that needs to happen.But let's -- let's -- I think that maybe part of this point that -- I how I think about it is we've got to get past this era of politics and partisan politics slowing down what we need to do in terms of progress in our country. And that means working across the aisle.I've done that before. We did it around whether it be -- what we were able to accomplish with the bipartisan infrastructure deal or some of the work that we have done in terms of dealing with gun safety.But we've got to work across the aisle and it is my commitment to work with Democrats, with Republicans, with independents to deal with a number of issues.Whether it be what we need to do in terms of housing and creating legislation that creates incentives for that.What we need to do to reinstate the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do.Whether it be what we need to do to actually invest in a substantial way in the industries of the future, in American-based manufacturing, in American-based industries where American workers and union workers have those jobs in a way that is good-paying jobs that gives people the dignity they deserve.All of those areas I plan on working across the aisle and with Congress, including the issue of immigration which we've got to fix.COOPER: Let me ask you, you've talked about codifying Roe v. Wade. That would obviously require 60 votes in the Senate, a majority of the House.That's a big -- that's a big leap. You don't -- we don't have that yet.If that's not possible to codify it in the House, what do you do?HARRIS: I think we need to take a look at the filibuster to be honest with you, but the reality of it is this, let's talk about how we got here.When Donald Trump was president, he hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade, and they did as he intended. And now, in 20 states, we have Trump abortion bans, that include punishing healthcare providers, doctors and nurses.In Texas, do you know they provide for prison for life for a health care provider for doing the job that they believe is in the best interest of their patient? Laws -- Trump abortion bans, some that make no exception even for rape or incest?One of the areas I special in as a -- specialized in as a prosecutor was crimes against women and children. The idea you would tell a survivor of a violation to their body that they have no right to make a decision about what happens to their body next? This is what's happening in our country.You all may have heard the stories. Women have died. Women have died because of these laws.And the suffering -- I have to say, Anderson, traveling -- for example, I -- again, I was with Liz Cheney this week. She is unapologetically pro-life and will also tell you that she doesn't agree with what's been happening.I -- I find that many people I've met who are pro-life have said to me, you know, I didn't intend that this would happen. I would -- I didn't intend that women who are suffering a miscarriage would develop sepsis as has happened many times. I didn't intend that women would die. I didn't intend that there would now be restrictions on access to in vitro fertilization. I didn't intend that there would be an effort to limit access to contraception.So, you know, this is probably one of the most fundamental freedoms that we as Americans could imagine which is the freedom to literally make decisions about your own body.And on some issues, I think we've got to agree that partisanship should be put aside.And I'll close with this point: I know it's possible because when you look at the midterms, in so-called red states and so-called blue states, when this issue of freedom was on the ballot, the American people voted for freedom.COOPER: This is Leanne Griffiths. She's registered with no party affiliation. She's a student at the University of Pennsylvania.She says she's leaning toward supporting you, has yet to make up a final decision because she isn't sure who's better for the economy.Leanne?HARRIS: Yeah.LEANNE GRIFFITHS, STUDENT AT UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA: Hi, Vice president. Thank you for being here today.HARRIS: Of course.GRIFFITHS: Considering you have been in the pos position of vice president for the past four years under the Biden administration, how can we expect you to deviate from the direction of that administration compared to your own?[21:20:08]How can we differentiate your policy and your beliefs from that of Biden's?HARRIS: That's a great question. And thank you.Well, first of all, my administration will not be a continuation of the Biden administration. I bring to this role my own ideas and my own experience. I represent a new generation of leadership on a number of issues and believe that we have to actually take new approaches.For example, what we talked about in terms of housing. I -- my experience that leads to that priority includes what I did to take on the big banks around the foreclosure crisis when I brought billions of dollars to homeowners that were the subject of predatory lending. I know what homeownership means to the American people, not to mention what it meant to my mother, who worked very hard and saved up so that by the time I was a teenager she was able to buy our first home.I bring to it my experience actually taking care of my mother when she was sick. And it was, as it turned out, dying from cancer. And so I know what it means and have the experience of taking care of an elderly relative and I have raised children.And so I bring, too, my priorities and will, as president, a new approach and a new idea, frankly, about what we need to do to deal with the sandwich generation, which is what we call those folks who are literally in the middle. Who are raising their young children and taking care of their parents, which is why my plan and approach says, hey, you shouldn't have to -- to wipe out all your savings to qualify for Medicaid to be able to get support, to hire somebody to help you cook for your parent or help them put on a sweater. I've done that. I know what that requires.You shouldn't have to quit your job in order to do the work that is necessary to take care of your children and your parent because it's overwhelming to try to do it all. And so my plan is to have and allow Medicare to cover the cost of home health care for our seniors.These are a couple of examples, including what we talked about in terms of price-gouging and what we need to do in addition. And it's a new approach that I think is well overdue. Let's invest in the small businesses of America. I -- the woman who helped raise us was a small business owner. I know who small business owners are. I know what they do. They are the backbone of America's economy. And for too long we've overlooked their value to the economy as a whole, much less to the economy of neighborhoods and communities.So that's why my plan, and it's a new approach, is about tax cuts for our small businesses so that they can invest in themselves and grow and in the process, invest in communities, invest in neighborhoods, and strengthen our economy overall.So those are some examples. It's about a new approach, a new generation of leadership based on new ideas and, frankly, different experiences. I bring a whole set of different experiences to this job and the way I think about it than...COOPER: Some...HARRIS: Than Joe Biden. COOPER: Some voters, though, might ask, you've been in the White Housefor -- for four years. You were vice president, not the president. But why wasn't any of that done over the last four years?HARRIS: Well, there was a lot that was done, but there's more to do, Anderson. And -- and I'm pointing out things that need to be done that haven't been done but need to be done. And I'm not going to shy away from saying, hey, these are still problems that we need to fix.COOPER: I want you to meet Jaxon Weiss. He's a student at Drexel University from Flourtown, Pennsylvania, a registered Republican, says he's leaning toward voting for you but has yet to make a final decision.Jaxon?JAXON WEISS, STUDENT AT DREXEL UNIVERSITY: Thank you, Anderson.HARRIS: Hi, Jaxon.WEISS: Thank you for taking the time to be here too, Vice President Harris.HARRIS: You too, thank you.WEISS: Regarding the rapid increase in the migrant population, how will you ensure that every immigrant is integrated into American society safely? What benefits and subsidies will you provide them with? And how long will these benefits and subsidies last for an individual? Most importantly, will the American citizens' taxes pay for these benefits and subsidies? And if so, how much -- how much money will be allocated?HARRIS: Well, thank you, Jaxon.Let's start with this. America's immigration system is broken and it needs to be fixed. And it's been broken for a long time. And part of what we need to do is always prioritize what we need to do to strengthen our border. I will tell you, I'm the only person in this race among the two choices that voters have, I've personally prosecuted transnational criminal organizations in the trafficking of guns, drugs, and human beings. I have spent a significant part of my career making sure that our border is secure and that we do not allow criminals in, and we don't allow that kind of trafficking to happen and come into our country.[21:25:01]And as the -- as my opponent has proven himself, he would prefer to run on the problem, instead of fix the problem.You may know there were some of the most conservative members of the United States Congress working with others that came up with a border security bill that would have put 1,500 more border agents at the border. Those border agents are overwhelmed. They need the support. They need the backup. It would have allowed us to have more resources to stem the flow offentanyl. I don't need to tell this state and people around the country what is happening in terms of the scourge of fentanyl and how it is literally killing Americans. It would have put resources into stemming the flow.It would have given more resources to prosecute -- to investigate and prosecute transnational criminal organizations. It would have done a lot of good. Donald Trump got wind of the bill and told them, don't put it forward. He killed the bill because he preferred to run on a problem, instead of fixing a problem.We have to have a secure border and we have to have a comprehensive pathway for citizenship.COOPER: Let me...HARRIS: And that includes requiring people, hardworking people, to earn citizenship and do it in a comprehensive, humane and orderly manner.COOPER: Let me ask you about that.You're talking about the bill that Donald Trump quashed in 2024. You talked about the bill he tried to get passed in 2021. That wasn't able to get passed. 2022, 2023, there were record border crossings. Your administration took a number, hundreds of executive actions. It didn't stem the flow. The numbers kept going up.Finally, in 2024, just in June, three weeks before the last -- the first presidential debate with Joe Biden, you instituted executive actions that had a dramatic impact, really shut down people crossing over. Why didn't your administration do that in 2022, 2023?HARRIS: First of all, you're exactly right, Anderson. And, as of today, we have cut the flow of immigration by over half. In fact, the numbers I saw most recently...COOPER: Yes.HARRIS: ... illegal immigration is lower...COOPER: But if it was that easy with that executive action, why not do it in 2022, 2023?HARRIS: Well, hold on. Let me finish -- let me -- well, because we were working with Congress and hoping that actually we could have a long-term fix to the problem, instead of a short-term fix.COOPER: You couldn't have done one and both at the same time?HARRIS: Well, here's the thing.We have to understand that, ultimately, this problem is going to be fixed through congressional action. Congress has the authority and the purse. I hate to use D.C. terms, but, literally, they write the checks. Part of the issue is, in order to really fix the problem at the border -- I was just at the border recently talking with border agents.You know what they talk about? Yes, they are overwhelmed. They're working around the clock. And the other thing that they talked to me about, we need more judges down there to deal with asylum claims. We need more personnel down there to deal with processing.But, Anderson, and that's where Congress kicks, in terms of dedicating the resources to actually fixing the problem. We have dealt with it such that, to your point, we now, as of today, as of our visit, have lower undocumented immigrants and illegal immigration than Trump when he left office.COOPER: That's true.HARRIS: But we need a permanent solution.COOPER: Do you wish you had done that...HARRIS: And that requires bipartisan work.COOPER: Do you wish you had done those executive orders in 2022, 2023?HARRIS: I think we did the right thing.And -- but the best thing that can happen for the American people is that we have bipartisan work happening. And I pledge to you that I will work across the aisle to fix this longstanding problem. I think the American people are demanding it on both sides of the aisle.COOPER: Yes.HARRIS: And it's time we actually put the partisan approach to this aside. We know what can work.COOPER: Well, let's talk about this compromise bill you -- that you want to pass if you're elected. You said that's going to be a priority.It includes $650 million in funding for the border wall. That's something Republicans wanted. That was part of the compromise. Under Donald Trump, you criticized the wall more than 50 times. You called it stupid, useless, and a medieval vanity project.Is a border wall stupid?HARRIS: Well, let's talk about Donald Trump and that border wall.(LAUGHTER)HARRIS: So, remember, Donald Trump said Mexico would pay for it? Come on. They didn't. How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2 percent.And then when it came time for him to do a photo-op, you know where he did it? In the part of the wall that President Obama built. So, come on.COOPER: But you're agreeing to a bill that would earmark $650 million to continue building that wall.HARRIS: We -- I pledge that I am going to bring forward that bipartisan bill to further strengthen and secure our border. Yes, I am. And I'm going to work across the aisle to pass a comprehensive bill that deals with a broken immigration system.[21:30:00]I think Jackson's question, part of it was to acknowledge that America has always had migration, but there needs to be a legal process for it. People have to earn it. And that's the point that I think is the most important point that can be made, which is we need a president who is grounded in common sense and practical outcomes. Like let's just fix this thing. Let's just fix it. Why is there any ideological perspective on it? Let's just fix the problem.COOPER: To fix the problem, you're doing this compromise bill. It does call for $650 million that was earmarked under Trump to actually still go to build the wall.HARRIS: I'm not afraid of good ideas where they occur, Anderson.COOPER: You heard me say, you don't think it's stupid anymore?HARRIS: I think what he did and how he did it did -- was did not make much sense because he actually didn't do much of anything. I just talked about that wall, right? We just talked about it. He didn't actually do much of anything.COOPER: But you do want to build some wall?HARRIS: I want to strengthen our border.COOPER: This is Annalise Kean. She's from Philadelphia. She works as a fundraiser for Habitat for Humanity. She's registered with no party affiliation. She says she's a Democrat. She's leaning toward voting for you, but says she's yet to make her final decision in part because of the conflict in the Middle East.Annalise?ANNALISE KEAN, FUNDRAISER FOR HABITAT FOR HUMANITY: Thank you. And good evening, Madam Vice President.HARRIS: Good evening.KEAN: My question is, as president, what would you do to ensure not another Palestinian dies due to bombs being funded by U.S. tax dollars?HARRIS: So I will say, and I think this is to your point, far too many innocent Palestinian civilians have been killed. It's unconscionable. And we are now at a place where with Sinwar's death, I do believe we have an opportunity to end this war, bring the hostages home, bring relief to the Palestinian people, and work toward a two-state solution where Israel and the Palestinians in equal measure have security, where the Palestinian people have dignity, self-determination, and the safety that they so rightly deserve.COOPER: What do you say to voters who are thinking about supporting a third-party candidate or staying on the couch, not voting at all because of this issue?HARRIS: Listen, I am not going to deny the strong feelings that people have. I don't know that anyone who has seen the images who would not have strong feelings about what has happened, much less those who have relatives who have died and been killed. And I know people and I've talked with people.So I appreciate that. But I also do know that for many people who care about this issue, they also care about bringing down the price of groceries. They also care about our democracy and not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.They also care about the fact that we need practical, common-sense solutions from a leader who is willing to work across the aisle on behalf of the American people and not themselves. They want a president who cares about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body, understanding that we're not trying to change anyone's belief, but let's not have the government telling women what to do with their body.COOPER: I want you to meet Beth Samberg. She's a realtor, a mom of four from Bellwood, Pennsylvania. She's a registered Democrat, says she's undecided because of concerns about anti-Semitism.Beth.BETH SAMBERG: Hi. Thank you for being here.HARRIS: Thank you, Beth.SAMBERG: Thank you for remembering, we need to bring the hostages home.HARRIS: Of course.SAMBERG: The rise of anti-Semitism and violence from -- the rise of anti-Semitism and violence from anti-Semitism has risen greatly on college campuses and on our city streets in the last year. How would you combat this growing trend and protect our young adults?HARRIS: Thank you, Beth. You are right. And I will say that we have seen a rise in anti-Semitism. It is something that we have to be honest about and we have to deal with. As attorney general, I actually published a hate crimes report, on a regular basis and anti-Semitism was among the highest forms of hate in our country. And this was before October 7. And we know what we've seen since.Part of what we've got to do is talk with people so that they understand what are the tropes, what are the roots of -- of what we are seeing, so that we can actually have people be more understanding. We need to have laws in place that make those who would commit crimes on behalf of anti-Semitism and hate that they pay a serious consequence. We need to have the deterrence so that doesn't happen. We need to ensure that college students are safe in their school and feel safe to be able to go to class.But I'm going to tell you what doesn't help. Again, I invite you to listen and go online to listen to John Kelly, the former chief of staff of Donald Trump, who has told us Donald Trump said, why -- essentially, \"Why aren't my generals like those of Hitler's, like Hitler,\" who has referred, several times -- we've heard the reports for years.[21:35:27]COOPER: Do you believe Donald Trump is Antisemitic?HARRIS: I believe Donald Trump is a danger to the well-being and security of America.COOPER: He has said that he -- he's casting himself as a protector of Israel. Do you believe you would be more pro-Israel than Donald Trump?HARRIS: I believe that Donald Trump is dangerous. I believe that, when you have a president of the United States who has said to his generals, who work for him because he is commander in chief -- these conversations, I assume many of them took place in the Oval Office.And if the president of the United States, the commander in chief, is saying to his generals, in essence, \"Why can't you be more like Hitler's generals?\" Anderson, come on. This is a serious, serious issue. And we know who he is. He admires dictators, sending love letters back and forth with Kim Jong-un; talks about the president of Russia, and then, most recently, the reports are that, in the height of COVID, when most Americans could not get their hands on a COVID test, Americans were dying by the hundreds a day, he secretly sent COVID tests to the president of Russia for his personal use.So, again, there -- this -- this election in 13 days is presenting the American people with a very significant decision. And on the one side, on this issue of who is going to model what it means to use the bully pulpit of the president of the United States in a manner that, in tone, word and deed, is about lifting up our discourse, fighting against hate, as opposed to fanning the flames of hate, which Donald Trump does consistently.I -- I'm going to tell you. We are an incredible country, and we love our country. You all wouldn't be here unless we love our country. And there are certain things where we've just got to come together and realize that -- that -- that we do believe in the importance of healthy debate on real issues, but there are certain standards we've got to have.And, you know, another point that even John Kelly talked about, I believe, and many have, is January 6th, where you have the president of the United States defying the will of the people in a free and fair election and unleashing a violent mob, who attacked the United States Capitol. One hundred forty law enforcement officers were attacked. Some were killed.And so I -- I say that to say the American people deserve to have a president who encourages healthy debate, works across the aisle, not afraid of good ideas wherever they come from, but also maintains certain standards about how we think about the role and the responsibility, and certainly not comparing oneself in a clearly admiring way to Hitler.COOPER: We're going to take a quick break. We'll have more from the CNN town hall with Vice President Kamala Harris.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[21:43:05]COOPER: And we're back with Vice President Kamala Harris.I want to ask you about something I read. I read that the fir -- one of the first phone calls you made after President Biden announced that he was dropping out was to your pastor. And I'm wondering if it wasn't a confessional, if you could say what that conversation was like.HARRIS: Well, my pastor, Reverend Dr. Amos C. Brown of Third Baptist Church.It was -- it was an extraordinary day that Sunday when the president called me, and I -- I instinctively understood the gravity of the moment, the seriousness of the moment.I didn't predict or know exactly how that day would play out, and obviously now, it's been three months since I've been at the top of the ticket, actually three months as of yesterday. But I just called him -- I needed that spiritual kind of connection, I needed that advice, I needed a prayer.And -- and there's a -- there's a part of the Scripture that talks about Esther and a time such as this, and -- and that's what we talked about. And it was very comforting for me and --COOPER: Do you pray every day?HARRIS: I do pray every day. I do pray every day, sometimes twice a day.COOPER: Yeah.HARRIS: I -- you know, my -- I grew up -- so we grew up -- a little neighborhood church in Oakland, 23rd Avenue Church of God.And I was raised to believe in a loving God, to believe that your faith is a verb, you know? You -- you live your faith and -- and that -- that the way that one should do that is that your work and your life's work should be to think about how you can serve in a way that is uplifting other people.[21:45:08]That is about caring for other people. And that guides a lot of how I think about my work and -- and what is important.COOPER: Let's go to the voters. I want you to meet Joe Donahue from Bucks County, Pennsylvania.HARRIS: Joe.COOPER: He works in customer service for a local retailer. He serves as a local election official. He's a registered Republican who says he's undecided. He doesn't agree with your stance on abortion, but he is concerned about what he calls Trump's demeanor and actions on January 6th.Joe?HARRIS: Hi, Joe.JOE DONAHUE, CUSTOMER SERVICE WORKER & LOCAL ELECTION OFFICIAL: Thank you, Madam Vice President.And thank you, Anderson.Madam Vice President, everybody as human beings, we are not perfect. We have our flaws. We make mistakes. We have our weaknesses. And the office of the presidency can sometimes bring those weaknesses out in ways that the incumbent may not expect. What weaknesses do you bring to the table and how do you plan to overcome them while you're in office?HARRIS: That's a great question, Joe.Well, I am certainly not perfect, so let's start there. And I think that I -- perhaps a weakness, some would say, but I actually think it's a strength is I really do value having a team of very smart people around me who bring to my decision-making process different perspectives. I -- my team will tell you I am constantly saying, let's kick the tire on that. Let's kick the tires on it. Because, listen, I -- as I mentioned earlier, I started my career as a prosecutor. I was a courtroom prosecutor.I've tried everything from low level offenses to homicides. And I learned at a very early stage of my career and adult life that my actions have a direct impact on real people in a very fundamental way. When I was attorney general of California, I was attorney general of what is the fifth-largest economy in the world, and acutely aware that my words could move markets. So I take my role and responsibility as an elected leader very seriously. And I know the impact it has on so many people I may never meet.And that is why I engage and bring folks around. So I may not be quick to have the answer as soon as you ask it about a specific policy issue sometimes because I'm going to want to research it. I'm going to want to study it. I'm kind of a nerd sometimes, I confess. And some might call that a weakness, especially if you're, you know, in an interview or just kind of, you know, being asked a certain question and you're just expected to have the right answer right away. But that's how I -- that's how I work.COOPER: We -- I don't think I've ever heard the former president admit a mistake. A lot of politicians don't. Is there something you can point to in your life, political life or in your life, in the last four years that you think is a mistake that you have learned from?HARRIS: I mean, I've -- I've made many mistakes. And they range from, you know, if you've ever parented a child you know you make lots of mistakes to, in my role as vice president? I mean, I've probably worked very hard at making sure that I am well-versed on issues and I think that is very important. It's a mistake not to be well-versed on an issue and feel compelled to answer a question.COOPER: I want you to meet Pam Thistle. She's from Wyndmoor, Pennsylvania. She's a realtor. She's a widow. Her husband, Mike, died just a year ago. She has two daughters in college.HARRIS: I'm sorry.COOPER: She registered with no party affiliation and says she's undecided. She has concerns about how you would handle the economy.Pam?PAM THISTLE, REALTOR: Thank you. And thank you, Anderson.And happy belated birthday too.HARRIS: Thank you. Thank you very much.THISTLE: I really...HARRIS: I'm sorry for your loss.THISTLE: Oh, thank you. Yes. And I'm really appreciative for you to be here and get to know you. When you talk about rich people paying their fair share, can you be more specific? Income taxes are already on a graduated scale where the more you make, the higher percentage you pay in taxes. So the rich are paying a disproportionate amount in taxes as it is. Over 40 percent of Americans don't pay any income taxes. Also, the really high-earners may move their money offshore if there are disincentive -- disincentives in the U.S., this could impact the economy. I would like to hear more nuts and bolts about your economic plans.HARRIS: Sure. Thank you, Pam.So, first of all, it is the case in the United States of America that billionaires on average pay less taxes as a percentage than teachers and firefighters and nurses. And that...THISTLE: Yeah, I'm talking about hard workers like -- like, pound the street, have some success.[21:50:06]HARRIS: Yes. No, no, no, I understand.THISTLE: Yes.HARRIS: But I want to just -- let's set the -- let...THISTLE: Not the really high...HARRIS: Let's set the scene, right?THISTLE: Yes.HARRIS: So, when I say that the richest among us need to pay their fair share...THISTLE: OK.HARRIS: ... I am referencing that, and I -- I need to reference that because, sadly, Donald Trump when he was president gave tax cuts to the richest, to billionaires in big corporations, which added trillions of dollars to our deficit.So that, sadly, needs to be said in a way that should be obvious to your point, but is not given what he did.Now, in terms of what we need to do to bring down taxes, I have pledged and have a plan for a middle-class tax cut that would affect 100 million Americans, including, for example, what we will do around small businesses, in terms of tax deductions, in terms of what small businesses are now being mired in terms of a bureaucracy around they have to fill out and do their taxes in a way that actually holds them back.Part of my plan includes extending a middle-class tax cut that would include a $6,000 tax cut, essentially a child tax credit, for parents, and young parents, in particular, knowing that the vast majority of our parents have a natural desire to parent their children well, but not always the resources.So this is going to include an extra amount of just money that people can use to pay for childcare, which is far too expensive for too many working families. And part of the issue here is this. We cannot and I will not raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.But we do need to take seriously the system that benefits the richest and does not help out working middle-class Americans. I come from the middle class, and I believe that the middle class needs tax breaks to be able to actually not just get by, but get ahead.COOPER: So you're saying -- well, what you're saying is anyone under $400,000 won't have taxes raised. Are you saying that anyone above $400,000 will have a tax raise?HARRIS: I'm saying that there is going to be a parity around what the richest people pay in terms of their taxes.Right now, Anderson, you know the documented -- it is well-documented that some of the richest people in our country have gotten away with a zero tax rate.COOPER: But if you're earning $500,000, $600,000, $700,000, under your plan, there's a good chance your taxes go up?HARRIS: It's -- we can't have this conversation without knowing what -- it's a very complicated situation, right? If you're talking about a small business owner, I'm going to bring down, cut taxes for small businesses, right?Because I know that they need the overhead, the money that they need for overhead to actually benefit the growth of their business, which benefits our economy as a whole.COOPER: Let's go to -- actually, let -- you know, I want to reference something that -- about Pam. Pam mentioned her husband, Steve, died a year ago.You have talked about your mom, Shyamala Harris, who died 15 years ago. What has grief been like for you? Do you still grieve?HARRIS: Yes, you don't stop grieving. You don't stop grieving.I mean, the -- I -- I think that there is -- there are like two sides to a coin when you have lost somebody you love, and -- or that two sides to a coin, that phrase becomes evident, which is, if you have had the blessing of a close and important relationship with someone, then, when you have -- that the other side of the coin is that, when you lose them, the grief becomes even deeper.But I also believe that, for example, anyone who has lost a family member through cancer or an illness -- my mother died from cancer -- it is important to try and remember them as they lived, and not as they died, because the grief can really weigh you down.I think the brain has a way of, when you're grieving, really spiraling down. And it's important, I think, to try and remember those you have lost in a way they'd want to be remembered, as being vibrant. And I think it's important to just -- to grieve as one does. I don't think there's any correct or proper way to grieve.And the most important thing is, I think, that people do not suppress what they're feeling at any moment. And the rest of us should give them grace to go through it as they will.COOPER: We're going to take a short break.We will be right back with more from the CNN presidential town hall with Vice President Kamala Harris.(COMMERCIAL BREAK)[21:58:43] COOPER: And we are back with Vice President Kamala Harris.I want to meet Rob MacPherson. He's the chief marketing officer for a local organization. He's registered Republican from Media, Pennsylvania, who told us he's leaning towards voting for you, but has concerns about what he calls shifts in your policy positions.Rob.ROB MACPHERSON, CHIEF MARKETING OFFICER: Thank you. Thank you for being here Vice President Harris. So, welcome to Delco.HARRIS: Thank you.(LAUGHTER)HARRIS: Thanks.MACPHERSON: Here in Delco, we pride ourselves on being authentic.HARRIS: Yes.MACPHERSON: And much of we have seen -- by saying -- have seen -- much of what you have been saying with regard to issues like law and order and fracking reflect a more centrist view than what people are used to hearing from Kamala Harris, leaving some voters to wonder about the authenticity of your current, more moderate positions.Can you talk a little bit about how your positions have shifted and why?HARRIS: Sure. And thank you.So, first of all, on fracking, I have been very clear. We kind of dispensed with this in 2020. I am not going to ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, as vice president, I cast the tiebreaking vote that now has opened up more fracking leases.My value on the issue of what we need to do to invest in a clean energy economy and a clean energy future has not changed. But, frankly, I now have the experience and perspective of having been vice president for almost four years. I have traveled the country.[22:00:06]"

                "text_body": "TAPPER: Live from the Bank United Center on the campus of the University of Miami, this is the CNN Republican Presidential debate. For our viewers in the United States and around the world, welcome to Miami Florida, I’m Jake Tapper. TAPPER: In just five days voters will go to the polls here in this state as well as in Ohio, Illinois, North Carolina and Missouri. The race for the Republican nomination for president could change dramatically. Florida and Ohio each have a large number of delegates at stake and they award all of them to the candidate who wins. They’re a winner-take-all state. So that’s the first time that will happen in this primary season and this is the last debate before that critical round of voting. We hope tonight the candidates will give the voters specifics on their visions for America. So now let’s welcome the candidates. Ohio Governor John Kasich. (APPLAUSE) Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. (APPLAUSE) Real estate developer and businessman Donald Trump. (APPLAUSE) Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. (APPLAUSE) Ladies and gentlemen, the Republican candidates for president of the United States. (APPLAUSE) Before we begin this evening, we want to remember former first lady Nancy Reagan, who passed away this week. Her funeral will be held tomorrow and we would like to take a moment of silence to remember Nancy Reagan. (MOMENT OF SILENCE) Now, please rise for our national anthem performed by the Frost Singers from the University of Miami. (STAR SPANGLED BANNER) (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thanks to the Frost Singers from the University of Miami. Candidates, you can now take your positions behind the podiums while I briefly explain the rules. As moderator, I will attempt to guide the discussion, asking questions and followups. Joining me in the questioning this evening will be Washington Times reporter Stephen Dinan, CNN Chief Political Correspondent Dana Bash, and Salem Radio’s Hugh Hewitt. Candidates, you have one minute and 15 seconds to answer each question, and 45 seconds to respond to followups or for rebuttals if your name is invoked. That’s longer than you’ve had in previous debates. Timing lights will be visible. Those lights will warn you when time is up. And as you requested, a bell will also sound, like this. (BELL SOUND) We know that each of you wants to debate these important issues, but please wait until you are called upon and please do not talk over one another. These are the rules to which all of you agreed. Our goal this evening is a serious debate on the issues. It’s time now for opening statements. You’ll each have 30 seconds. Governor Kasich, we will start with you. KASICH: Well, thank you. You know, I look in the faces of people all across this country, and I know they want to be hopeful. And many are hopeful. Look, I can take conservative policies to the White House, to Washington, to restore the strength of our economy. But I also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because I believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states. And I believe it’s a new partnership - a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of America and strengthen America for the best century we’ve ever had. Thank you. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio? RUBIO: Every election is important. I believe this is the most important election in a generation. Because what’s at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. What’s at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people. RUBIO: For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation. And now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. If we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous Americans that have ever lived. And the 21st century is going to be a new American century. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz? CRUZ: Fifty-nine years ago, Florida welcomed my father to America as he stepped off the ferry boat from Cuba onto Key West. He was 18. He was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth. This election, this debate is not about insults. It’s not about attacks. It’s not about any of the individuals on this stage. This election is about you and your children. It’s about the freedom America has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop Washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of America. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party. Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they’re voting. They’re voting out of enthusiasm. They’re voting out of love. Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before - 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old - never voted before. We’re taking people from the Democrat Party. We’re taking people as independents, and they’re all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. It’s very exciting. I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what’s happening. We’re having millions of extra people join. We are going to beat the Democrats. We are going to beat Hillary or whoever it may be. And we’re going to beat them soundly. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you. Thank you. Let’s begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. There have been some real differences expressed in - on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers. One of Mr. Trump’s, the front runner’s, signature issues is ending what he calls “disastrous trade deals” in order to bring jobs back to America. Governor Kasich, I’d like to start with you. You’ve been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. Critics say these deals are great for corporate America’s bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs. How do you respond to the criticism that you’ve been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class? KASICH: Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family. And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we’re sensitive about trade. One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it. But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. And I’ve been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don’t turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, “Oh, America was right,” and people are out of work. The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker. But we don’t want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. People will buy less. Other people will be out of work. And we don’t want to see that happen. Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they’re a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up. And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. I understand their plight. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you’ve brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico. Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? TRUMP: Because nobody knows the system better than me. I know the H1B. I know the H2B. Nobody knows it better than me. I’m a businessman. These are laws. These are regulations. These are rules. We’re allowed to do it. And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it’s very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete. So I will take advantage of it; they’re the laws. But I’m the one that knows how to change it. Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me. TAPPER: Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you’re, quote, “generally very much in favor of free trade.” More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs? RUBIO: No, I support free trade deals that are good for America. We’re 5 percent of the world’s population. If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things. The problem is we’re a low-tariff country. To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can’t export to because their tariffs are too high. And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world. There are good trade deals and there are bad ones. So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia. It’s allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it’s created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. We have a surplus with Colombia. On the other hand, you’ve seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. Why should these voters who don’t like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years? CRUZ: Actually that’s incorrect. There are two different agreements. There’s TPA and TPP. I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about. And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans. But we’re getting killed in international trade right now. And we’re getting killed because we have an administration that’s doesn’t look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas. We’re driving jobs overseas. And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. But I’ll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well. And you’ve got to understand. Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. So the question is, what’s the solution? It’s easy to talk about the problems. But do you have a solution to fix it? And I think the solution is several things. Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room. Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back. And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I’ve introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Let’s talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers. Let’s go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen. DINAN: Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements. You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. Doesn’t this program take jobs away from Americans? RUBIO: If it’s being abused the way Disney did. Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers. Under that program, you have to prove not only that you’re not replacing Americans, but that you’ve tried to hire Americans. And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again. The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don’t understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India. That company then hoards up all of these visas. They hire workers. You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company. What they’re basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they’re employees of this consulting business. And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it. It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans. And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future. DINAN: Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this. (APPLAUSE) You’ve - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you’ve called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured. RUBIO: Correct. DINAN: Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you’ve talked about are solved. RUBIO: Well first, I think - well, I’d be open to it if it takes a pause. But I don’t think it takes a pause to enforce the law. What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American. If there’s an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that’s in violation of the law. And what I’m explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job. They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. They are making the argument that we didn’t replace you. We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. And that company that they’re hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. It’s a loophole they’ve figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next. Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, “lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers”. He’s calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. Wouldn’t that help workers in the U.S.? KAISCH: Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn’t be standing here. I’d be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn’t have immigration. Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. But we clearly have to control our borders. We can’t have people just walking in. Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. The country has to be able to lock its doors as well. So, we - I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration. I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. No excuses because we can’t continue this problem. I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home. And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they’ve been here, they get a path to legalization. Not to citizenship. I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days. But let’s not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget. We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we’ll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington. And guess what, I’ve used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I’ve been governor DINAN: Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you. Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like. TRUMP: I will. First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well. And it’s something that I frankly use and I shouldn’t be allowed to use it. We shouldn’t have it. Very, very bad for workers. And second of all, I think it’s very important to say, well, I’m a businessman and I have to do what I have to do. When it’s sitting there waiting for you, but it’s very bad. It’s very bad for business in terms of - and it’s very bad for our workers and it’s unfair for our workers. And we should end it. Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read. And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he’s the only one that’s going to be able to fix it. Because it is a mess. I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what’s going on. We have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. And we’re rushing into things, and we’re just - we’re leading with the chin. (BELL RINGS) We’re leading with people that don’t know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. I’d say a minimum of one year, maybe two years. DINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to bring you in very quickly on this. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. What should the right level be? CRUZ: Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy. Right now, we’re bringing in far too many low skilled workers. What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans. Our system isn’t working. And then on top of that, we’ve got a system that’s allowing in millions of people to be here illegally. And the answer to that, I’ve laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. We’re going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. We’re going to end sanctuary cities. And let me tell you how we’re going to do that. We’re going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: We’re going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. And the thing to understand, Stephen, we can solve these problems. It’s not that we don’t know how to do it. It’s that we’re lacking the political will. Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this. The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor. CRUZ: We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. We need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio, did you want to weigh in? RUBIO: Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren’t actually workers at all. They are just coming in primarily based on family connection. And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system. The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don’t have skills. When my parents came, they had a very limited education. My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. And I’m grateful every day that America welcomed them. But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don’t have skills is very difficult. We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards. The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have? What business are you going to open? What investment are you going to make? What job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the United States? (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. The United States has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. American students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading. Mr. Trump, you’ve called the education standards known as Common Core a disaster. What are your specific objections to Common Core? TRUMP: Education through Washington, D.C. I don’t want that. I want local education. I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great. And it was very interesting, I was with Dr. Ben Carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is… (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: We were talking. We spoke for over an hour on education. And he has such a great handle on it. He wants competitive schools. He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. But charter schools work and they work very well. So there are a lot of things. But I’m going to have Ben very involved with education, something that’s an expertise of his. TAPPER: OK. But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. So when you say “education by Washington, D.C.,” what do you mean? TRUMP: You’re right, Jake. But it has been taken over by the federal government. It was originally supposed to be that way. And certainly sounds better that way. But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what’s happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases. Now in some cases they would be. But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, you have called opposition to Common Core hysteria. What is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you? KASICH: Well, look, all I’m in favor of in Ohio is high standards. First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. OK, I’ve been working on this for many, many years. Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum. Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state. Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids? We need to start connecting them to the real world. We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago. We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs. Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. And that’s exactly what we’re doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be. So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. That’s what it is in the state of Ohio. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: So, Senator Cruz, let me bring you in. You object to Common Core. Governor Kasich says it’s local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. What’s wrong with that? CRUZ: Common Core is a disaster. And if I am elected president, in the first days as president, I will direct the Department of Education that Common Core ends that day. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it’s easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core. Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that. (APPLAUSE) Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments. And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. And give every child - African American, Hispanic - every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Let’s move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida. Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they’re very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations. Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash. BASH: Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable. For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans. So, what should the new retirement age be? And how much will those benefits be cut? RUBIO: Well, first of all, let me say that you’re right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare. One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. I’m against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother. And we don’t have to make any changes for them. But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying. Any politician that goes around saying, “We don’t have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,” they’re not being honest with you. Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents. For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I’m supposed to retire, I’d have to retire at 68. If I were still in the Senate, I’d be one of the youngest people there. (LAUGHTER) If I’ve made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better. Medicare Advantage does that now. These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator, the question was specific though. You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits? RUBIO: Well, I’m sorry I didn’t answer that part. So the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. And so my children would retire at 70. I would retire at 68. It would be a graduating scale over a period of time. But again I’m talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old. We’re years away from retirement. For people that are on it now, we don’t have to change it at all. If we don’t do anything, we will have a debt crisis. It’s not a question of if. It is a question of when. In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt. That’s - all of it will be eaten up by that. That’s a debt crisis. And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Mr. Trump, you don’t want to raise the retirement age, and you also don’t want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans. But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening? TRUMP: Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I’ve watched them very intensely, even though it’s a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security. They’re leaving it the way it is. In fact, they want to increase it. They want to actually give more. And that’s what we’re up against. And whether we like it or not, that is what we’re up against. I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant. TRUMP: And it’s my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is. Not increase the age and to leave it as is. You have 22 years, you have a long time to go. It’s not long in terms of what we’re talking about, but it’s still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP… I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters. If that ever happened in China. you would have had a depression like nobody’s ever seen before. They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it’s a - it’s a national tragedy. We’re at zero, we’re not doing anything. We’ve lost our jobs. We’ve lost everything. We’re losing everything. Our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. I want to make America great again and I want to leave Social Security as is. We’re going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump. You’re talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you’re talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent. So how would you find that other $147 million? TRUMP: Because they don’t cover most of the subjects. We’re the policemen of the world. We take care of the entire world. We’re going to have a stronger military, much stronger. Our military is depleted. But we take care of Germany, we take care of Saudi Arabia, we take care of Japan, we take care of South Korea. We take - every time this maniac from North Korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. We get virtually nothing. We have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between North and South Korea. We have so many places. Saudi Arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. We are going to be in a different world. We’re going to negotiate real deals now, and we’re going to bring the wealth back to our country. We owe $19 trillion. We’re going to bring wealth back to our country. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security? RUBIO: No. And I - and I think you’ve outlined why. The numbers don’t add up. You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we’re going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that’s the end of your campaign. In Florida, you can’t talk about that, but people know that it’s the truth here in Florida. Fraud is not enough. Certainly, let’s wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won’t add up. You already gave those numbers. The second point is on foreign aid. I hear that all the time as well. I’m against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it’s less than 1 percent of our federal budget. The numbers don’t add up. The bottom line is we can’t just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I’m going to get at fraud and abuse. Let’s get rid of fraud, let’s get rid of abuse, let’s be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. But you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you’re going to have to make up. And here’s the thing. If we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. Not to mention a crisis in Social Security and Medicare. Both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. It is one of the major issues confronting America. It’s barely been asked in any of these debates. And we’d better deal with or we’re going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Mr. Trump, Senator Rubio says your numbers don’t add up. What’s your response? Senator Rubio says that your numbers don’t add up. What’s your response, Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Well, I don’t know if he’s saying that. Look, I’m just saying very simply we have a country that I’ve never seen anything like it. I’ve been going over budgets and looking at budgets. We don’t bid things out. We don’t bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. They don’t go out to bid. They just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. That’s what they’re paying. And the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. They take care of all of the senators, the Congressmen. They have great power and they don’t bid out. The military is never properly bid. When we go out to military bids, it’s not properly bid. And the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don’t want, only because that particular company has political juice, OK? I’m self-funding my campaign. Nobody is going to be taking care of me. I don’t want anybody’s money. I will tell you something. We’re going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. We’re going to save a fortune. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their Social Security taxes into personal accounts. What do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal? CRUZ: Well, number one, we need to see responsibility. Social Security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it’s irresponsible. And any politician that doesn’t step forward and address it is not being a real leader. We need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen Social Security. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And as president, what I will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. Every benefit will be protected to the letter. But for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. And as you noted Dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And one of the things that is critically important. Listen, we’ve got lots of challenges in the world. But the answer can’t just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. You have to understand the problems. You have to have real solutions. It’s like government spending. It is very easy. Hillary Clinton says she’ll cut waste, fraud and abuse. If only we had smarter people in Washington, that would fix the problem. You know what? That is the statement of a liberal who doesn’t understand government is the problem. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Here’s my philosophy. The less government, the more freedom. The fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. And there are bureaucrats in… (BELL RINGS) … Washington right now who are killing jobs and I’ll tell you, I know who they are. I will find them and I will fire them. BASH: Did you justice just compare Donald Trump to Hillary Clinton on this issue? CRUZ: I will let Donald speak for himself. But I will say, there’s a reason, in my campaign I’ve laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. I’ve specified five major agencies that I would eliminate, 25 programs. And Dana, you know why political candidates don’t do that? Because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. When you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. Let’s talk for example back in Iowa the first primary. When I went to Iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. You can’t take on ethanol in Iowa. And my opponents on this stage not only didn’t do the same. They attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare. (BELL RINGS) If we’re going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you’ve got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs I’ll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump, would you like to respond? TRUMP: Yes. If you look back to Iowa, Ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. He did and - at the end. Not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. And you know, I think everybody knows that. It was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change. BASH: Senator Cruz? CRUZ: Listen, if you are fed up with Washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on Washington? It’s easy to have language, I’m fed up with the corruption in Washington. But if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal Democrats and funding the Washington establishment, it’s very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on Washington. When I stood up and led the fight against Obamacare, Washington was furious and attacked me, but I did it because I was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of Obamacare. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: When I led the fight against amnesty, it’s because I was standing with the people… (BELL RINGS) … against Washington. And if you want to tell people you’re going to stand against Washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in Washington? BASH: OK. Mr. Trump, I’ll let you respond because he mentioned you but then I’m going to move to Governor Kasich. Go ahead. TRUMP: Well, that’s fine. First of all, Ted was in favor of amnesty. So there’s no question about that. And Sheriff Joe Arpaio recently endorsed me and there’s nobody tougher on the borders than Sheriff Joe. And Jeff Sessions, one of the most respected Senator in Washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me. And there’s nobody that knows more about the borders than Senator Jeff Sessions. I would say this. We’re all in this together. We’re going to come up with solutions. We’re going to find the answers to things. And so far I cannot believe how civil it’s been up here. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Governor Kasich, let’s get back to Social Security. You told a voter in New Hampshire to quote, “Get over cuts to Social Security benefits” because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. Why is cutting Social Security payments the solution? KASICH: Well, first of all, we hear about taking on Washington. I took on Washington and I won. I actually got the budget balanced when I was a member of the Congress, the chairman of the budget committee. We paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. We also balanced the budget four years in a row. And we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then. I also had a plan in 1999 to save Social Security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have Social Security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. Now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a UFO than a Social Security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous. KASICH: I have a plan to fix it that doesn’t even require raising the retirement age. If you’ve had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on Social Security, you’ll still get it. It will just simply be less. And for those people who depend on that Social Security, they’ll get their full benefit. That’s the way it will work. And we don’t have to monkey around with the retirement age. And how do I know that? I’ve done all this before. This is not a theory. Do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? Yes. It doesn’t mean you have to cut them. It means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st Century. So not only did we have a balanced budget in Washington, but when I went to Ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we’re $2 billion in the black. Our credit is strong. We’re up 400,000 jobs. And I want to go back with the same formula to beat the Washington insiders again. And I will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Let’s take a broader look at the Republican Party now. Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition. How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader? What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016? TRUMP: Well, first of all, I don’t really think that. I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people. We are more inclusive. And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it’s, again, the biggest story. You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. I am different in one primary respect, and that’s trade. I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs. You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. So that’s that. But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don’t do it because we don’t play the game. and the only way we’re going to be able to do it is we’re going to have to do taxes unless they behave. If you don’t tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we’re going to continue to lose businesses and we’re going to continue to lose jobs. And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. It has gone down. And I think that’s why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I’m saying. TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz… (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: … Donald Trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. Those people are signing up to his vision of the Republican Party. What do you think is wrong with that vision? CRUZ: Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. He’s right about the problems. But his solutions don’t work. So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods. Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. I don’t know where he’ll be tonight. But I’ll tell you what happens. You know, we’ve seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression. And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs. A much better solution that works is the tax plan I’ve laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. Fix the problem and that’s what’s missing from what Donald says. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump, we’ll give you a chance to respond. TRUMP: The 45 percent tax is a threat. It was not a tax, it was a threat. It will be a tax if they don’t behave. Take China as an example. I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China. They can’t. China won’t let them. We talk about free trade. It’s not tree free trade, it’s stupid trade. China dumps everything that they have over here. No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything. We can’t get into China. I have the best people, manufacturers, they can’t get in. When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax. The 45 percent is a threat that if they don’t behave, if they don’t follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. It doesn’t have to be 45, it could be less. But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz? CRUZ: Jake, let me be clear what Donald just said. He said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. And mind you, you are paying the tax. It’s not China that pays the tax. It’s you, the working men and women. So ask yourself at home: How is this helping you? If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can’t pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, “I’m going to jack - I’m going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing.” That hurts you. It’s why we’ve got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America. TAPPER: OK. TRUMP: Jake, I have to say - honestly, it’s just the opposite. What will happen if they don’t behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. Instead of in China, we’ll build them here. And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we’re being ripped off. And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now. So we’ll build our factories here and we’ll make our own products. And that’s the way it should be done. And the way we’ve been doing it for the last long period of time is our country - our country is in serious, serious trouble. It’s a bubble and it’s going to explode, believe me. TAPPER: All right. We’re going to take a very quick break. When we come back, we’ll have much more of this Republican presidential debate from the University of Miami right after this. Stay with us. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida. Mr. Trump, let me start with you. Last night, you told CNN quote, “Islam hates us?” Did you mean all 1.6 billion Muslims. TRUMP: I mean a lot of them. I mean a lot of them. DINAN: Do you want to clarify the comment at all? TRUMP: Well, you know, I’ve been watching the debate today. And they’re talking about radical Islamic terrorism or radical Islam. But I will tell you this. There’s something going on that maybe you don’t know about, maybe a lot of other people don’t know about, but there’s tremendous hatred. And I will stick with exactly what I said to Anderson Cooper. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: Senator Rubio, your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, said in response to Mr. Trump’s comment last night, I’m sorry - Senator Jeff Flake, I apologize. Your supporter, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in response to that comment, Republicans are better than this. Do you agree? RUBIO: Well, let me say, I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. The problem is, presidents can’t just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: And so let me give you one. Two days ago, I met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in Bangladesh. It’s a very tough place to be a missionary. It’s Muslim. And their safety and security very much relies upon friendly Muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well. And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn’t like Muslims. So this is a real impact. There’s no doubt that radical Islam is a danger in the world. I can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you’re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world you’re going see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: And they love America. And as far as I know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the United States military. Anyone out there that has the uniform of the United States on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves America. No matter what their religious background may be. DINAN: Mr. Trump? (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: Marco talks about consequences. Well, we’ve had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon and could have been the White House. There have been a lot of problems. Now you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. I don’t want to be so politically correct. I like to solve problems. We have a serious, serious problem of hate. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: There is tremendous hate. There is tremendous hate. Where large portions of a group of people, Islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. Let me go a step further. Women are treated horribly. You know that. You do know that. Women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad. (BELL RINGS) Now I will say this, there is tremendous hatred. The question was asked, what do you think? I said, there is hatred. Now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. And everybody would say, oh, isn’t that wonderful. DINAN: Mr. Trump, thank you. TRUMP: We better solve the problem before it’s too late. DINAN: Senator Rubio? (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: Well, here we go. See, I’m not interested in being politically correct. I’m not interested in being politically correct. I’m interested in being correct. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: And in order to be correct on this issue, here’s the bottom line. We do work. There is - Islam has a major problem on its hands. It has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the Sunni faith but also in the Shia, who have been radicalized. And are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people. There is no doubt about that. It is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other - with Muslims, who do not - who are not radicals. We’re going to have to work with the Jordanian kingdom. We’re going to have to work with the Saudis. We’re going to have to work with the Gulf kingdoms. We’re going to have to work with the Egyptians to defeat, for example, ISIS. (BELL RING) RUBIO: It will take a Sunni Arab movement to defeat them. And so I think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. We are going to have to work with people of the Muslim faith even as Islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization. TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) Governor Kasich, do you think Islam hates us? KASICH: No, I don’t. I think there is a sect of, you know, this radical Islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. There isn’t any question. And that’s why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don’t have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction. But look, I was there when, and saw it, when the Egyptian ambassador to the United States was in the Rose Garden bringing the Arab Muslim world to work with us to repel Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. The fact is that if we’re going to defeat ISIS, we’re going to have to have these countries. And they are Egypt. And they are Saudi Arabia. And they are Jordan. And they are the Gulf states. And we’re going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with Turkey. And I frankly think the Europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected Turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of Europe. The simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these Muslim countries, they are just - they can’t believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith. Look, the people who represent radical Islam, they want to destroy everything that we’re about and other Muslims who don’t share their view. But at the end of the day, we’ve got to bring the world together, the civilized world. And we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody. TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. Mr. Trump, I want to ask you about something else you’ve said during the course of this campaign. You said that the U.S. has to, quote, “take out” the families of terrorists. When it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the Geneva Conventions, you said, quote, “So they can kill us, but we can’t kill them?” It is against federal, military and international law to target civilians. So how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law? TRUMP: Let me go back to the other just for a second. In large mosques, all over the Middle East, you have people chanting “death to the USA.” Now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me. As far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law - this all started with your question on water boarding. We have a law that doesn’t allow right now water boarding. They have no laws. They have no rules. They have no regulations. They chop off heads. They drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. And we’re working on a different set of parameters. Now, we have to obey the laws. Have to obey the laws. But we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out ISIS and all of the others that are so bad. We better expand our laws or we’re being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. They are laughing at us, believe me. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists? RUBIO: No, of course not. And we don’t have to in order to defeat terrorists. The way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. It’s difficult to do, but it has to be done. When I’m president of the United States, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. They’re going to be expanded. And the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists. And then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because - because Barack Obama is gutting our military. He’s going to leave us with the smallest Army since the end of World War II, and the smallest Navy in a century, and the smallest Air Force we’ve ever had. We are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. And if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they’re not going to have the right to remain silent. And they’re not going to go to a courtroom in Manhattan. They’re going to go to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and we will find out everything they know and we’ll do so legally. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, you’ve talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against ISIS. Would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists? CRUZ: No, of course not. We’ve never targeted innocent civilians and we’re not going to start now. But listen, Jake, I understand. People are scared and for seven years, we’ve faced terrorist attacks and President Obama lectures Americans on Islamophobia. That is maddening. But the answer is not simply to yell, “China bad, Muslims bad.” You’ve got to understand the nature of the threats we’re facing and how you deal with them. And yes, it is true there are millions of radical Islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. We need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them. CRUZ: And I’ll tell you, frankly one concern I have with Donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on Iran, he has said he would not rip up this Iranian nuclear deal. I think that’s a mistake. The Ayatollah Khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. I’ll give you another example, dealing with Islamic radical terrorism. On Israel, Donald has said he wants to be neutral between Israel and the Palestinians. As president, I will not be neutral. And let me say this week, a Texan, Taylor Force. He was an Eagle Scout, he was a West Point graduate, he was an Army veteran. He was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist this week in Israel, and I don’t think we need a commander in chief… (BELL RINGS) … who is neutral between the Palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of Israel. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump. we’re going to come to you in a second, but wait. I want to go to Hugh Hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject. HEWITT: Mr. Trump, I want to follow-up on the quote that Senator Cruz used. You said you would want to be, quote, “sort of a neutral guy”. He did mention Taylor Force. He was a West Point graduate, he was a war hero. He was a Vanderbilt graduate student. He was killed in a Palestinian terror attack near Tel Aviv, many others were killed. And the Israeli government says the Palestinian authority is inciting this. Do you still want to stay neutral when the Palestinian authority is inciting these attacks. TRUMP: First of all, there’s nobody on this stage that’s more pro Israel than I am. OK. There’s nobody. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I am pro-Israel. (BOOING) TRUMP: I was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the Israeli Day Parade down 5th avenue. I’ve made massive contributions to Israel. I have a lot of - I have tremendous love for Israel. I happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are Jewish, OK? And two grandchildren that are Jewish. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: But I will tell you, I think if we’re going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every Israeli wants, and I’ve spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, I think it would be much more helpful is - I’m a negotiator. If I go in, I’ll say I’m pro-Israel and I’ve told that to everybody and anybody that would listen. But I would like to at least have the other side think I’m somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. Maybe we can get a deal. I think it’s probably the toughest negotiation of all time. But maybe we can get a deal done. HEWITT: Senator Trump… (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: And, by the way, just so you understand, as far as Iran, I would have never made that deal. I think it’s maybe the world deal I’ve ever seen. I think it’s the worst deal I’ve ever seen negotiated. I will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they’ve ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. That deal will be broken. HEWITT: Thank you Mr. Trump. Senator Cruz and Senator Rubio. CRUZ: You know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. The reason we are friends and allies with Israel is they are a liberal Democratic country that share our values, they’re our strongest ally in the region. We get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. And the Palestinian Authority that Donald, along with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as Israel. The Palestinian Authority is in a unity government with Hamas, a terrorist organization. They pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. And this is exactly the moral relativism Barack Obama has. And the answer is not scream, all Muslims bad. Let me give you an example of a Muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, President el-Sisi of Egypt, a president of a Muslim country who is targeting radical… (BELL RINGS) … Islamic terrorist. HEWITT: Senator Rubio. CRUZ: He’s hunting them down and stomping them. HEWITT: Thank you. CRUZ: Our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe. HEWITT: I want to go back to the Israeli government’s assertion that the Palestinian Authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. Do you agree. RUBIO: Well, that’s undeniable. First of all, they’ve said, they’ve encouraged people to do so. And you’ve seen the speeches of the Palestinian Authority president how glorious this is that they’re doing these sorts of things. But let me go back for a moment. The policy Donald has outlined, I don’t know if he realizes, is an anti-Israeli policy. Maybe that’s not your intent but here’s why it is an anti-Israeli policy. There is no peace deal possible with the Palestinians at this moment. There just isn’t. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: Because there’s no one to negotiate with. The Palestinian Authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with Hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the Jewish state. Every time that Israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is Gaza, or now in Judea and Sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack Israel. And that’s what will happen again. These groups are not interested in a deal with Israel. What they are interested in is ultimately removing the Jewish state and occupying its entire territory. (BELL RINGS) So maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now. HEWITT: Mr. Trump, and then I’ll come to you Senator Kasich. RUBIO: And To have a president forcing the Israelis to the table is harmful to the Israeli and emboldens Israel’s enemies. HEWITT: Thank you senator. (APPLAUSE) Mr. Trump a response and then we’ll go to Governor Kasich. TRUMP: If I become president of the United States, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of Israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look. But I would like to give it a shot. Very, very pro-Israel, nobody more pro-Israel. But I would love to give it a shot. And I have to tell you this, Hugh. I have friend, Israelis, non-Israelis, people from New York City that happen to be Jewish and love Israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it’s tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in Israel. And some believe it’s possible. It may not be, in which case we’ll find out. But it would be a priority if I become president to see what I could do. HEWITT: Governor Kasich, do you agree the Israeli government that the Palestinian Authority is inciting this violence? KASICH: Well, there’s no question. They were saying that the Israelis intended to go to the Dome of the Rock. And I mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with Israelis to give them the Iron Dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. Could you imagine living in like Miami here and having people shooting missiles in? Secondly, there was just an article the other day, Hugh, that I know you’re familiar with the Israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the Palestinians now, Hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under Israel. They’re coming at them from above, they’re trying to come at them under the ground. And I just have to tell you this, I don’t believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. And I think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. I believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the Israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the Middle East in regard to Israel. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to stay in the region. Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it’s going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix - to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq. From the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon. So here’s the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war? CRUZ: We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS. And that’s needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. Right now we’re not using a fraction of the tools that we have. We’re not using our overwhelming air power. We’re not arming the Kurds. Those need to be the first steps. And then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out. But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I’m glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back. They’re not able to fight. They’re not able to defend themselves. They’re not able to kill the enemy. And I have got to tell you, Hugh, I think that is wrong. It is immoral. And I give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in January 2017. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Governor Kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the Pentagon says that’s what needs to be done, will you follow their advice? KASICH: Hugh, I’ve said all along and laid out my foreign policy, I’m going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said I was the best to be commander-in- chief. I spent 18 years on the Defense Committee, Armed Services, and then I was in the Pentagon with Donald Rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years. We absolutely have to win this with a coalition. Arabs have to be with us. The Europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer - is as close as it is to us. And in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground. And you bring all the force you need. It has got to be “shock and awe” in the military-speak. Then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that’s what it takes. HEWITT: Mr. Trump, more troops? TRUMP: We really have no choice. We have to knock out ISIS. We have to knock the hell out of them. We have to get rid of it. And then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. We have no choice. HEWITT: How many… (CROSSTALK) TRUMP: I would listen to the generals, but I’m hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. We have to knock them out fast. Look, we’re not allowed to fight. We can’t fight. We’re not knocking out the oil because they don’t want to create environmental pollution up in the air. I mean, these are things that nobody even believes. They think we’re kidding. They didn’t want to knock out the oil because of what it’s going to do to the carbon footprint. We don’t fight like we used to fight. We used to fight to win. Now we fight for no reason whatsoever. We don’t even know what we’re doing. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: So, the answer is we have to knock them out. We have to knock them out fast. And we have to get back home. And we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart. TAPPER: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Let’s turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts. Senator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A. The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate. What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need? RUBIO: Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that’s struggling with the V.A. my brother is a veteran. He’s struggling with the V.A. The other day, we heard this horrible story. It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, “Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail.” Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen - one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. And they happened to call him back the day after he died. People need to be held accountable for this. One of the things I’m proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I’ll give him credit - Bernie Sanders was a part of this - we passed a V.A. accountability bill. And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren’t doing a good job. Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn’t working. The problem is no one’s being held accountable. Even after we passed that law, no one’s been fired for no outreach. No one’s been fired for calls going to the voicemail. No one’s been disciplined. No one’s been demoted. When I’m president of the United States, if you work at the V.A. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the V.A. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, the Veterans Affairs Department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. As part of its attempt to cut costs, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 GI Bill. Should veterans’ benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit? KASICH: I don’t - I haven’t seen the provisions of that bill, Jake. My initial instincts are no. And let me just say about the V.A. When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one. Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured. It needs to be downsized and spread out. It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans. And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans’ service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job. And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they’re our golden employees. No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America. TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. (APPLAUSE) Let’s turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida. Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba. Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States. Let’s go back to my colleague Dana Bash. BASH: Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba. The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well. So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong? RUBIO: Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change. But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government. Today, it has not. The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made - after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime. It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. They’ll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. And nothing will change for the Cuban people. There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. The only thing that’s changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently. And we asked nothing in return. Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma. And by no means is Burma a perfect country. But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body. He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions. It’s harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine. Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said? TRUMP: Well, I don’t really agree with President Obama. I think I’m somewhere in the middle. What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don’t make good deal. We don’t have our right people negotiating, we have people that don’t have a clue. As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody’s talking about it and they’ll end up signing a deal and then we’ll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion. All that stuff has to be agreed to now. We don’t want to get sued after the deal is made. So I don’t agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be - should take place. After 50 years, it’s enough time, folks. But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that’s going to happen. This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. So I want to do something, but it’s got to be done intelligently. We have to make good deal. BASH: Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in. But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them? TRUMP: I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba’s favor. Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba’s favor. It the same way as the Iran deal. We never walked - we never - all we do is keep giving. We give and give and give. BASH: But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. Which would it be? In Havana. TRUMP: I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. It’s the same building. So it could just go back to being called a consulate. We don’t have to close it that way. Second of all, I don’t know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they’re going to lose. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal. I’ll tell you what the good deal now, it’s already codified. Here’s a good deal - Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs. And you know what? Then we can have a relationship with Cuba. That’s a good deal. (APPLAUSE) BASH: Thank you, Senator Rubio. Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba? CRUZ: Yes, I would. And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters. When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy? When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. There’s a real difference between us. Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they’re doing. The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn’t be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us. (APPLAUSE) CUBA: Thank you Senator Cruz. Mr. Trump. TRUMP: Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear. And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it’s got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States. As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal. That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. It is a disaster. So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it’s a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I’ve ever seen negotiated. So don’t try to put it on me like it’s wonderful, like I love it. BASH: Senator Cruz, your response? CRUZ: Well, look. I’ll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry. CRUZ: And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. No. We don’t just need smarter people in government. We need leaders that are protecting American interests. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And when it comes to Iran, Donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the Ayatollah Khomeini over $100 billion. That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us. We need a commander in chief that understands our enemies… (BELL RINGS) … understands and doesn’t give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: I was against the giving of the money at all cost. I said don’t negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. If the prisoners don’t come back early - three years ago. One of the longest negotiations I’ve ever seen, by the way. If they don’t come back early, I was saying don’t negotiate. They come back early. What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. Cause that deal is a disaster. Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. But that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the United States. BASH: Thank you Mr. Trump. Let’s refocus this back on Cuba. Governor Kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from Alabama and North Carolina have just received approval to build the first U.S. factory in Cuba, making tractor for small farms. This is a direct result of President Obama’s policy in Cuba that we’ve been talking about. If you were elected would you encourage more U.S. companies to do business like that in Cuba? KASICH: No, I wouldn’t. Listen, I think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is America doing? You know, you don’t support us, we can’t figure out where you are. You won’t arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people. You had a red line in Syria. You walked away from it. You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile. And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal. Look, I know in human nature sometimes there’s a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. And you know what happens when you do that? You make a terrible mistake. You need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here… (APPLAUSE) KASICH: … and you need to negotiate tough deals. The fact is, they need to understand who we are. The Chinese understand. They don’t own the South China Sea. They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we’ll take out their systems. We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid. We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you’re either with us or you’re against us. We’re not rattling a sword. You’re not our enemy but we’re not going to put up with this nonsense any longer. And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for. Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world. (BELL RINGS) When I’m president, they’re going to know exactly where we are because we’re coming back. TAPPER: Thank you governor. Thank you governor. While we’re discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening. Mayor Regalado told me, quote, “Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It’s an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?” Unquote. Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you. Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it? RUBIO: Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: There’s never been a time when the climate has not changed. I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it? So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it’s caused by two things. Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation. And I have long supported mitigation efforts. But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there’s no such thing. (APPLAUSE) RUBIO: On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he’s forcing down our throats on the war on coal. Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? Americans are going to pay the price of that. The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living. RUBIO: The businesses who are going to leave America because it’s more expensive to do business here than anywhere else. And you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment? Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels. So, I am in favor of a clean environment. My children live in South Florida. My family is being raised here. I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy. TAPPER: So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he’s saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change. When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he’s wrong? RUBIO: I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. If we pass - if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. Sea level would still rise. All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons. One, because America is not a planet. It’s a country. And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. Here’s what he will immediately - and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend - but here’s what he’s going to immediately going to start hearing from. He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. That cost will be passed on to working families. I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, what would you say to the mayor of Miami? KASICH: Well, I - I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don’t think it has to be a, you know, either you’re for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you’re not going to have any jobs. The fact is, you can have both. In our state, we’ve reduced emissions by 30 percent. But let me tell you also what we’re trying to do. We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas. We believe in nuclear power. And you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter. Now, it doesn’t mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don’t know how much humans actually contribute. But it is important we develop renewables. Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world. So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another. TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad. He said, quote, “foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed.” Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States? CRUZ: Of course it does. And we’ve seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks. Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America. Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on. I’ll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, “it is hard to be friends with America; we can’t count on America; America doesn’t stand with us.” And that is a disgrace. But the good news is, Jake, we’ve seen this before. We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter. And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight. It’s worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office. (APPLAUSE) And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. That’s why on day one, I will rip to shreds this catastrophic Iranian nuclear deal because the Ayatollah Khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. TAPPER: Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China’s massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you’ve said: “When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. That shows you the power of strength.” How do you respond… TRUMP: That doesn’t mean I was endorsing that. I was not endorsing it. I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. And then they kept down the riot. It was a horrible thing. It doesn’t mean at all I was endorsing it. As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia. I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you. I mean, for Russia, that doesn’t mean I’m endorsing Putin. TAPPER: But the word strong obviously is a compliment… (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: … and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities. TRUMP: I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany. Germany is a disaster right now. So I used to think that. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: And strong doesn’t mean good. Putin is a strong leader, absolutely. I could name many strong leaders. I could name very many very weak leaders. But he is a strong leader. Now I don’t say that in a good way or a bad way. I say it as a fact. TAPPER: Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre. What do you think? KASICH: I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids. And when that guy stood in front - that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government. (APPLAUSE) KASICH: Now I will tell you, I don’t believe that we need to make China an enemy. They are a competitor. But I want to go back to three things they should do. We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he’s doing, number one. Number two, they need to realize they don’t own the South China Sea. And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea. And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we’re going to have to beef up the cyber command. And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. The president has not given the cyber command that authority. I will. And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can’t manipulate their currency. That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with. And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Governor Kasich. We’re going to take another quick break. When we come back, we’ll have more of the Republican presidential debate from Miami, Florida, right after this. Stay with us. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Welcome back to the CNN Republican presidential debate in Miami, Florida. Mr. Trump, I want to start with you in this block. Earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in Fayettville, North Carolina. This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies. Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. She said, quote, “this kind of behavior is repugnant. We set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence.” Do you believe that you’ve done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged? TRUMP: I hope not. I truly hope not. I will say this. We have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people - you’ve seen it yourself. People come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest - in some cases - you know, you’re mentioning one case, which I haven’t seen, I heard about it, which I don’t like. But when they see what’s going on in this country, they have anger that’s unbelievable. They have anger. They love this country. They don’t like seeing bad trade deals, they don’t like seeing higher taxes, they don’t like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. And I know - I mean, I see it. There is some anger. There’s also great love for the country. It’s a beautiful thing in many respects. But I certainly do not condone that at all, Jake. TAPPER: Some of your critics point to quotes you’ve made at these debates - at these rallies including February 23rd, “I’d like to punch him in the face,” referring to a protesters. February 27th, “in the good ol’ days, they’d have ripped him out of that seat so fast.” February 1st, “knock the crap out of him, would, you? Seriously, OK, just knock the hell. I promise you I will pay for the legal fees, I promise, I promise.” (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: We have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. They are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. And we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness I don’t mind. But doing serious damage. And if they’ve got to be taken out, to be honest, I mean, we have to run something. And it’s not me. It’s usually the municipal government, the police because I don’t have guards all over these stadiums. I mean, we fill up stadiums. It’s usually the police - and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job. (APPLAUSE) So we should pay - we should truly give our police. They’re incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the Republican party for the general election? CRUZ: Listen, I think for every one of us, we need to show respect to the people. We need to remember who it is we’re working for. You know, we’ve seen for seven years a president who believes he’s above the law, who behaves like an emperor, who it is all about him and he forgot that he’s working for the American people. And let me - let me ask, turn the camera our here. How many of y’all feel disrespected by Washington? (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Washington isn’t listening to the people. And that’s the frustration that is boiling over. And we need to nominate and elects a president who remembers, he works for the people. You know, at Donald’s rallies recently, he’s taken to asking people in the crowd to raise their hand and pledge their support to him. Now, I got to say to me, I think that’s exactly backwards. This is a job interview. We are here pledging our support to you, not the other way around. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: And the only hand raising I’m interested in doing is on January 20, 2017 raising my hand with my left hand on the… (BELL RINGS) … bible and pledging to the American people to preserve, protect and defend the constitution of United States. TAPPER: Thank you senator. Mr. Trump, if you’d like to respond. TRUMP: It shows the total dishonesty of the press. We were having - on a few occasions, again massive crowds. And we’re talking and I’m saying who is going to vote on Tuesday? Who is going to vote? The place goes crazy. Then I say, hey, do me a favor. Raise your right hand. Do you swear you’re going to vote for Donald Trump? Everyone’s laughing, we’re all having a good time. That’s why I have much bigger crowds than Ted, because we have a good time at mine. (APPLAUSE) TRUMP: But we’re all having a good time and the next day, on the Today Show and a couple of other place, not too many. Because when you look at it, everyone’s smiling, laughing. Their arms are raised like this. They had pictures, still pictures of people and they tried to equate it to Nazi Germany. (BELL RINGS) It is a disgrace. It was a total disgrace. And I’ve had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that - what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party’s chances in November? KASICH: Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period. I mean, it’s - you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters. Jake, here’s what I think is happening. There are people out there who are worried about their jobs. They’re worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they’re out of work and they’re 54 years old and they don’t know where they’re going to get another job, a man and a woman. Maybe they’re worried about a trade deal. They’re worried about the fact that their wages haven’t gone up. They’re worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great. They went to college, they rang up debt and they’re still living in their parents’ basement. People are uptight. Our seniors are worried they’re going to lose their Social Security. There’s two ways to treat it. You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed. If we’re Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems. We can provide financial security, we can drive the wages up, we can get kids jobs with a more robust economy. (BELL RINGS) And you know what? They want to help solve these problems right where they live and I’ll give them the power to do it. TAPPER: Thank you governor. Senator Rubio? I know you want to say something. RUBIO: I do. A couple of points. The first is, I’m concerned about violence in general in this society. And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers. And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us. On the issue of anger. Yes, people are angry. Of course they’re angry. Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years. But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us. But to motivate us to take action. Being here in Miami is special. My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up. And he would sit on the porch of our home and tell me all kinds of stories and things I learned about history. My grandfather was born in 1899 before there were airplanes in the sky. One night in the summer of 1969, he watched a man set foot on the moon. (BELL RINGS) You know what he said when he saw that? He said Americans can do anything. Americans can do anything. There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation. TAPPER: Thank you senator. RUBIO: And embrace all of the principles that made us great. TAPPER: Thank you senator. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention. Let’s go back to Salem Radio’s Hugh Hewitt. HEWITT: Thank you Jake. Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention. If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates. Why shouldn’t the person with the most delegates, even if it’s not a majority of delegates, be the nominee? KASICH: Well, first of all, let’s not - you know, math doesn’t tell the whole story in politics. The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what’s true today is not necessarily true tomorrow. So let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK. KASICH: If you got an 86, you got a B. Because everybody else had an 84 didn’t mean you got an A. So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee. And frankly, I don’t know if we’re going to get a convention like that. But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him. He tried valiantly. He lost. Gerald Ford won. The party was united. Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon. He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first. And we were healed as a party. So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. We don’t know what’s going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected. And that’s what’s going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks. (APPLAUSE) HEWITT: Thank you, Governor. Mr. Trump, if you arrive in Cleveland with a plurality and the most, but not a majority, is it legitimate for someone else to emerge from that convention the nominee? And if so, would you support that person? TRUMP: I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever - first of all, I think I’m going to have the delegates. OK? I think. Let’s see what happens. (APPLAUSE) But if somebody doesn’t have the delegates, and I guess there’s two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment. But if - no, that’s just - by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism. That’s just a mathematical fact. OK? If two of us get up there, I would say this, if - if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win. That’s what I think. HEWITT: Senator Cruz, if you - if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election? CRUZ: Well, look, there are some folks in Washington… TRUMP: Make me president. (APPLAUSE) CRUZ: Donald, you are welcome to be president of the Smithsonian. (APPLAUSE) You know, there are some in Washington who are having fevered dreams of a brokered convention. They are unhappy with how the people are voting and they want to parachute in their favored Washington candidate to be the nominee. I think that would be an absolute disaster and we need to respect the will of the voters. (APPLAUSE) It’s one of the reasons why in the course of this election - listen, everyone up here has worked very hard. But Donald is right, there are only two of us that have a path to winning the nomination, Donald and myself. At this point, I have roughly 360 delegates. He has about 100 more than I have. We have at this point beaten Donald in eight separate states all over the country geographically, from Maine to Alaska, from Kansas to Texas, all over this country we have beaten him. And so for the people at home, if you’re one of the 65, 70 percent of Republicans who recognizes that if we nominate Donald Trump, Hillary wins. That’s why the media wants him to be the nominee so much. If you recognize that, then I want to invite you if you’ve supported other candidates, come and join us. We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting. It’s why Carly Fiorina endorsed me yesterday. It’s why Mike Lee endorsed me today. I ask everyone to come together. Let’s stand together and let’s beat Hillary Clinton in November. HEWITT: All right. Thank you, Senator. (APPLAUSE) Mr. Trump, then to Senator Rubio. TRUMP: You know, I listen and I watch Ted on television and when he speaks, and he’s always saying, “I’m the only one that beat Donald in six contests; and I beat him.” But I beat him in 13 contests. He never mentions that. (APPLAUSE) And let me just tell you another little fact, little minor fact. I have about a 1.6 million votes during this primary season, more votes than Ted. The other thing is, I beat Hillary, and I will give you the list, I beat Hillary in many of the polls that have been taken. And each week, I get better and better. And believe me, I haven’t even started on her yet. HEWITT: Senator Rubio? RUBIO: Let me tell you what this election is about for me. And I get all the delegate math and all that debate. Let me tell you what’s about for me. On Tuesday night, I didn’t do as well, obviously, as I wanted to. And I was a little bit disappointed when I got home. And my wife told me a story that night, which is the reason why I can get up the next day and keep fighting. There’s a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery. And his doctors told him he needs to be home resting. But every afternoon, he takes his little aluminum chair and he sits outside of an early polling center and holds a sign that says “Marco Rubio.” RUBIO: Because for him, I symbolize all the sacrifices that his generation made so their children could have a better life than themselves (APPLAUSE) That gentleman has not given up on me and I am not going to give up on him. I am going to work tirelessly every single day - (APPLAUSE) … because this election is too important. What’s at stake is the future of this country. And I believe - I believe that at the end of this process this nation will make the right choice because I’ve always believed that God has blessed America, that God’s hand is upon this country and that its greatest days are yet to come. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Senator. Let’s send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times. Stephen? DINAN: Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors. Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election? TRUMP: I have not made that decision yet. I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision. My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth. I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I’m turning down money. I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you. I don’t know if I get any credit for it but I’m self-funding my campaign. And other than - and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it’s not a large amount. No, I’m self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I’ve been in this business a long time and I was on the other side - until eight months ago I was on the or side. I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans. I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing. I will say this - people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians. I don’t want anybody to control me but the people right out there. And I’m going to do the right thing. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: Senator Cruz, I want to come to you. The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns. Do you deny that those big donors do have influence? CRUZ: Well look, absolutely. And one of the things we’re so frustrated about is the corruption, what I’ve called the Washington cartel. It’s career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests. And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he’s been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party. And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change. But the interesting point is tonight he hasn’t pointed to a single special interest he’s willing to take on. He didn’t take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street. He won’t take on ethanol. And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country. DINAN: Thank you, Senator. I want to go to Mr. Trump… CRUZ: $62 at tedcruz.org. DINAN: … for a response. Thank you, Senator. CRUZ: That’s who you’ve got to be accountable to, the people. TRUMP: Ted was given to PACs. I mean, PACs - you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks. Very corrupt. It’s going to lead to lots of disasters. But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one. It’s very important to do that. There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived. And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken. And I’m the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I’ve always made large contributions. And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I’m the only one up here that’s going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong. DINAN: Thank you, Mr. Trump. Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question. At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible. With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren’t willing to show flexibility? RUBIO: Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn’t be flexible about your principles. About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that. Listen, on the issue of higher education, I’m the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt. So I know this is a major issue. And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan. The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a - on a bipartisan basis. The sanctions that I helped - that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis. The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis. RUBIO: But I also want to be frank. There are issues we’re going to have to have an election over. When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that’s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that’s not going to be bipartisan. When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that’s probably not going to be bipartisan. There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government. And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military. (APPLAUSE) DINAN: All right. Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence. What are some of the other issues on which you’re willing to show flexibility? TRUMP: It depends on what comes up. You never know. It depends on what comes up. Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan. We had Tip O’Neill, speaker. And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully. Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made. And he made it with Tip O’Neill. We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint. And I’ll tell you this, it can be done. We don’t want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind. We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there’s total, absolute gridlock. DINAN: Thank you. I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir. KASICH: Well, look, my record speaks for itself. What I talk about tonight is not a theory. These are things that I’ve done. I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together. I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon. I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington. And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare, I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor. My problem isn’t that people don’t know this. They say, well, what does that mean? Does that mean you’re too easy? Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government. In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years. Conservative principles will work. But show respect to the other side. One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone. We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security. I know how to do it because I’ve done it and I’ll do it again. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Thank you, Governor. We have time for one last break. We’ll be right back after this. (APPLAUSE) (COMMERCIAL BREAK) TAPPER: And we’re back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections. It is time now for closing statements. Candidates, you will each have one minute. And we’ll start with Governor Kasich. KASICH: Well, I’d like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States. I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision. And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States. Sometimes being positive isn’t all that interesting, but it’s very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign. I can fix the problems in Washington, I’ve done it before. And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty. We can do this together. Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families. That’s where the spirit and strength of America is. But ask the people - my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote. God bless. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Rubio. RUBIO: It’s great to be here, back at home in Miami. It’s hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city. And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land. My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else. They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves. And that was possible because America is a special country. But that was not an accident. America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done. They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges. They embraced their opportunities. And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off. And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part. And I’m telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I’m elected president, this generation will do it’s part. We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Senator Cruz. CRUZ: What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support. CRUZ: In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton. And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values? Who will best defend your values and fight for you? I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, “Madam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration. You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future.” We can do better. We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe. That’s the choice I will put to her this fall. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: Mr. Trump? TRUMP: Thank you very much. The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it’s never known before. They’re coming by the millions. We should seize that opportunity. These are great people. These are fantastic people. These are people that love our country. These are people that want to see America be great again. These are people that will win us the election and win it easily. These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job. Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you’re going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover. It will take centuries to recover. So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party. And unify. Be smart and unify. (APPLAUSE) TAPPER: And that concludes this 12th Republican presidential debate. We want to thank the candidates, the Republican National Committee, the University of Miami and, of course, each of you for watching. I’m Jake Tapper.

                "title": "Trump previously backed policies on Social Security for which he’s now attacking DeSantis, calling the program a ‘Ponzi scheme’ | CNN Politics",
                "text_body": "Former President Donald Trump once backed raising the retirement age to 70 and called for privatizing Social Security which he called a “Ponzi scheme” – two positions he has hammered Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for supporting as a former member of Congress and congressional candidate. Trump made the comments in 2000 in a book he authored called “The America We Deserve,” when he was considering a third-party run for president as a member of the Reform Party. Trump,his campaignanda supporting PAChave repeatedly cited votes from DeSantis in Congress fornonbinding budget resolutionsthat would have raised the retirement age to 70. The campaign has also cited DeSantis’ praise of Paul Ryan’s budget plans during his 2012 congressional campaign with comments that expressed support for privatizing Social Security and Medicare – but a CNN KFile review found Trump himself also once praised Ryan on Medicare, along with the 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney, without praising their specific policy proposal, which called for similar changes to Ryan’s plan. In his book, Trump lamented big cuts the programwould needwithout changes, and said he would consider privatization. “The truth is undeniable, the workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme,” Trumpwrote. “The solution to the Great Social Security Crisis couldn’t be more obvious: Allow every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds.” “We can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy,” hewrote. The Trump campaign told CNN that that as president, Trump “has consistently showed he would always protect entitlements. In contrast, DeSantis has consistently voted to cut entitlements, and has long advocated raising the age of retirement.” “When President Trump was elected and went to Washington, DC, he saw just how corrupt and dangerous Paul Ryan was and prevented his disastrous ideas like cutting Social Security and Medicare from coming to fruition,” Steven Cheung, Trump’s spokesman, said in the statement. In a 1999interviewwith NBC News’ Tim Russert prior to the release of the book, Trump said he didn’t want to privatize the program but was open to it. “I don’t like the idea of privatizing Social Security. I think it’s certainly something that could be looked at. I think the Social Security system is in very serious trouble. Obviously, it’s always going to be backed by the country, but I think it’s in very serious trouble. I would look at privatization. I don’t know that that’s the answer.” “But you’d open to it?,” asked Russert . “I’m open to it, yes,” he said. By the 2010s, Trump broke from what was then Republican orthodoxy and said GOP efforts to change entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare would be political disasters and blasted the Ryan budget –urgingRomney not to embrace it as the nominee of the party. But in the 2012 presidential race, hedefendedthe Republican ticket – and praised Ryan – saying the pair would save the program. Theirplan at the timewas similar to the Ryan proposals that Trump has hammered DeSantis for supporting. “I think Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will save Medicare,” Trumpsaidto Fox News in August 2012. I know they will. And people are starting to understand it. They’re going to be very happy with what’s going on, but they’re going to be very, very unhappy if Obama gets in. I think actually if Obama gets in, and if Obamacare isn’t ended, I really think Medicare will be a thing of the past.” In October 2012, Trump again strongly praised Ryan on Medicare in an appearance on Fox News – saying his qualm with Ryan’s budget was he should’ve waited until after the election to make his plans public. “I certainly think it probably would’ve been more appropriate to have waited,” Trump told Sean Hannity. “But I like the energy he brings. I like a lot of the things he’s saying. He’s smart. He truly understands what’s going on with the 17 trillion and the budgets and everything else. “And I think he’s very strongly in favor of – I know for a fact that he’s gonna save Medicare. The other side’s gonna destroy Medicare. He’s going to save Medicare. And as we know it right now – not with big deductions and big cuts and big, he’s going to save Medicare. Medicare cannot exist with the other side in office. It will explode.” As a candidate for the Republican nomination in 2016, Trump reiterated his approach to not touching entitlements, saying his administration would not change either program. Abudget from Trump’s White Housedid eventuallycall for reducing spendingon Medicare, according to the nonpartisan Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, but those reductions would largely affect doctors and hospitals. At the same time, in an interviewhe later walked back, Trump said cuts to entitlements would eventually be on the table. “At some point they will be,” Trumpsaidin January 2020 in an interview with CNBC, comments that made their way into a response ad last week from asuper PAC supporting Ron DeSantisin a potential bid for the White House. Asked by CNBC whether he was willing “to do some of the things that you said you wouldn’t do in the past, though, in terms of Medicare,” Trump said: “We’re going to look.” In another interview in 2020, which he again walked back, Trump said he’d be cutting entitlements. When a Fox News host noted that trimming the national debt would require cutting entitlement programs, Trumprespondedthat it would be happening along with economic growth. “Oh, we’ll be cutting, but we’re also going to have growth like you’ve never had before,” Trump said. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The920-page Project 2025 blueprintwas organized by The Heritage Foundation think tank anddeveloped in significant part by people who served in Trump’s administration; Trump haspublicly distanced himself from the initiative,callingunspecified Project 2025 ideas “seriously extreme.” Project 2025’s proposals for right-wing policies and a radical reshaping of the executive branch have become frequent targets of Democratic criticism. At Harris’ Tuesday rally in Wisconsin, she criticized Trump and “his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” thensaid: “Can you believe they put that thing in writing? Read it. It’s 900 pages. But here’s the thing. When you read it, you will see Donald Trump intends to cut Social Security and Medicare. He intends to give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations and make working families foot the bill. They intend to end the Affordable Care Act. And take us back, then, to a time when insurance companies had the power to deny people with pre-existing conditions.” Facts First:One of Harris’ claims about Project 2025 is false, while another is at least misleading. TheProject 2025 documentdoes not show that Trump intends to cut Social Security; the document barely discusses Social Security at all and does not propose cuts to the program. In addition, contrary to Harris’ suggestion, Project 2025 does not call to “end” the Affordable Care Act or eliminate its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The document does criticize the Affordable Care Act, especially the law’s expansion of Medicaid, but makes clear it is advocating changes to the law rather than terminating the law entirely. A Harris campaign official said the campaign has “made a deliberate decision to brand all of Trump’s policies” as “Project 2025,” since they believe “it has stuck with voters.” ﻿After the initial publication of this article, a Harris campaign spokesperson, Joseph Costello, added, “Project 2025 is a blueprint for many of the dangerous policies we know that a second Trump term would include, and it is indisputable that in his first term, Donald Trump repeatedlytried to cut Social Securityand end the Affordable Care Act.” Mary Vought, a spokesperson for Project 2025 and the Heritage Foundation, said, “Harris should follow her own advice and read the book instead of promoting lies and misinformation.” No Project 2025 call to cut Social Security We won’t render a verdict on Harris’ claim about Project 2025 calling for cuts to Medicare, though Trump himself hasvowedhe will not cut even a cent from the health insurance program for seniors and people with disabilities. The Project 2025 document proposes multiple significant changes to Medicare, and it’s not clear what their overall impact would be. And there is a reasonable basis for Harris’ claim about Project 2025 wanting to give tax breaks to the wealthy and corporations. The project’s proposals to significantly restructure the tax code include a reduction in the corporate income tax rate andideasthat would disproportionately benefit high earners. Trump’s own proposal to extend the expiring provisions of his 2017 tax cut law alsofavorswealthy people. But contrary to Harris’ claim that “when you read” the Project 2025 document “you will see” that Trump intends to cut Social Security, the lengthy document includes no call to cut Social Security. In fact, the document uses the words “Social Security” just 10 times, mostly in passing. Vought said the document calls for “no changes to Social Security.” Harris could fairly have noted that Trump himself has expressed openness,both in decades pastand earlier this year, to cutting Social Security. When he was asked in a March interview about how he would handle Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, hesaid, “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements.” (He hassince vowednot to cut “one penny” from Social Security or Medicare.) But what Harris actually said is that the proof of a supposed Trump intention to cut Social Security in a second term is found in the Project 2025 document. It is not. No Project 2025 call to end the Affordable Care Act Harris at least suggested at the rally, though did not explicitly say, that the Project 2025 document includes a call to end the Affordable Care Act and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. But that’s not correct, either. The document criticizes the budget impact of the Affordable Care Act’s expansion of the Medicaid health insurance program for lower-income people. It also explicitly calls for some changes to the Affordable Care Act – popularly known as Obamacare – or its implementation. Those suggested changes include removing restrictions on physician-owned and specialty hospitals, better enforcing a provision of the law related to how insurers must handle money related to abortion, and coming up with “a plan to separate the non-subsidized insurance market from the subsidized market.” But the document makes no mention of changes to Affordable Care Act protections for people with pre-existing conditions. And its suggestions for changes to the law are clearly not suggestions to get rid of the law entirely. “It does not end the Affordable Care Act,” Vought said. Trump himselfrepeatedly promisedduring his 2016 election campaign to “terminate” Obamacare and replace it with an unspecified superior plan, butfailed to achieve his goal as president. In a social mediapostduring this campaign, in November 2023, he said he was “seriously looking at alternatives” to Obamacare, criticized Republican senators who had voted “not to terminate” the law, and added that “we should never give up!” Then, four days later, hewrote, “I don’t want to terminate Obamacare, I want to REPLACE IT with MUCH BETTER HEALTHCARE. Obamacare Sucks!!!” This story has been updated with a response from the Harris campaign. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

CDT THE PRESIDENT:  Hello, hello, hello.  (Applause.)  Good to see you all. Gov, as my father would say, “Excuse my back.”  I apologize.  (Laughter.) Hello, Milwaukee!  (Applause.) Thank you, Ray, for that introduction and for sharing your family’s story with so many of us. Your grandfather served our nation in uniform, and he started a family business only to see it demolished and the community disconnected because of a new highway.  But he never gave up and neither have you, nor have the people of this community, and I want to thank you.  (Applause.) Governor Evers, my good friend — thank you, Gov, you’re the best.  And I want to thank you for your partnership across the board for getting us through COVID, rebuilding the economy, and so much more. And the same goes for a great senator, Tammy Baldwin, and your incredible congresswoman, Gwen Moore.  (Applause.)  Is your son here? REPRESENTATIVE MOORE:  (Inaudible.) THE PRESIDENT:  All right.  Well, she represents her hometown with such incredibly integrity and tenacity.  (Applause.) Mayor Johnson, you’re one of the most impressive young mayors I’ve met, and I’ve met all of them, I think.  (Laughter.)  No, I really mean it.  Thank you.  (Applause.)  I don’t know where you’re sitting.  There you are.  Stand up, Mr. Mayor. I tell — I warn anybody: Don’t run for mayor.  They know where you live and they think you can solve allyour[their] problems.  (Laughter.) Thank you for your passport to the city and your leadership in this project I’m here to talk about. Look, to communities everywhere and at this Boys & Girls Club — and, by the way, I’ve been a gigantic supporter of Boys & — it’s the biggest in the country.  But when I was a senator, I provided a lot of money where — during the crime sprees were going on — for Boys & Girls Clubs.  What you do is you build confidence, you build spirit, you build a sense of belonging.  And it really matters. And this project is for you — a future you really deserve. Look, the story of Bronzeville here in Milwaukee is one that we see all across the country. Our interstate highway system, laid out in the ‘50s, was a groundbreaking connection.  Our nation, coast to coast — that was the purpose of it.  But it transformed the way people live, work, and travel. But instead of connecting communities, it divided them.  These highways actually tore them apart. I come from a city — Wilmington, Delaware — where if you’re ever — the same thing happened.  We’re in a situation where I-95 is four lanes going through a community that was all African American, and it just split it.  And it’s now about 50, 60, maybe 70 yards wide.  And I’m — I’m President, and I can’t get that done yet.  Why’d you guys get it first?  I don’t know.  (Laughter.) No, but all kidding aside.  The same thing happened here and many cities across the country. There were also cities all across America where highways used to be and they — along — you know, redlining — along with redlining, they disconnected entire communities from opportunities, sometimes in an effort to reinforce segregation. That’s what happened here in Milwaukee. More than a hundred years ago, Bronzeville was the home of a thriving hub of Black culture and commerce — homes and apartments owned by Black families; Black small businesses, from hotels to jazz clubs to restaurants like Ray’s grandfather’s. In the middle of the 20th century, tens of thousands of Black Americans migrated from the South to Milwaukee and other cities in the North to get good-paying manufacturing jobs. But by the ‘60s, the so-called “urban renewal” swept this country.  The construction of I-94 and I-43 tore down roughly 17,000 homes and 1,000 businesses, ripping through neighborhoods and nearby roads. Here on Sixth Street, the road was widened, displacing residents and businesses, all so the people outside the neighborhood could get downtown. Today, Sixth Street is a wide road without pr- — without a protected bike path — bike lanes or bus lanes, with limited access to the greenspace.  Speeding and reckless driving, resulting in a crashes five times that of the city’s average.  All of this looking people — locking people out of opportunities and leaving them more isolated from the social and economic life of the rest of the city. Congresswoman Moore told me: When she was a child, she lived a short walk from the public library — a safe place to read and learn, where libraries who were giving cake — the librarian would give cake to children when they showed up to read.  That’s true, isn’t it? REPRESENTATIVE MOORE:  That’s true.  (Laughter.) THE PRESIDENT:  But then the new plans disrupted the walk and made the library inaccessible. Sadly, too many communities across America have faced a loss of wealth, prosperity, and possibilities that still reverberate today. Imagine all those homes and mom-and-pop stores that could have been posted and passed down from family to family, and financial security and generational wealth would have resulted. Imagine what they conti- — what they contributed then and what they could’ve contributed all these years and what that would’ve meant for all of Milwaukee and all the communities across the country. For generations, Black, brown, and Native American, Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians communities weren’t fully included in our democracy or our economy.  But — yet, by pure courage, heart, and grit, they never gave up.  They pursued the full promise of America. Today, we’re recognizing that history to make new history. I’m here to announce a first-of-its-kind investment — $3.3 billion — $3.3 billion and 132 projects in 42 states that are going to help right historic wrongs — (applause) — and, in the process, delivering environmental justice by reconnecting disadvantaged communities and neighborhoods to new opportunities for future — future prosperity and many possibilities. These investments advance my Justice40 Initiative to deliver at least 40 percent — 40 percent of all the — all the benefits from clean transit, clean energy, and climate investments to disadvantaged communities.  That’s a commitment I made and we’re keeping. Here in Milwaukee, it will mean $36 million in new federal funding to rebuild Sixth Street.  (Applause.) It will mean wider sidewalks for children walking to school, safer bike lanes for residents and visitors, dedicated bus lanes to get work — to get to work faster, new — new trees to provide shade, and modern infrastructure to prevent sewage from flowing into the Milwaukee River and the Lake Michigan. These are life-changing improvements.  They’re also going to make it easier for historic Black communities in the north and Latino communities in the south to access jobs, school, and entertainment, opportunities in the city and central hub, from watching the Milwaukee Bucks play to attending Milwaukee Area Technical College. And if I didn’t mention the Technical College, I’d go home and sleep alone, because my wife is a full-time teacher at a community college.  (Laughter and applause.) You all think I’m kidding.  I’m not.  (Laughter.) And we’re going to ensure that good-paying construction jobs created in this project go to members of the community, benefitting the very same project.  (Applause.) And with the help of your congressional delegation, especially Senator Tammy Baldwin, who worked so hard for these funds, we’re making sure that the construction materials for this project are made in America.  (Applause.) And — and if I can digress — digress for one second.  Look, you know, I — I’ve been very involved for a while.  I know I don’t — I look like I just arrived, but I’m — (laughter). But all kidding aside, I didn’t realize, even though I was deeply involved initially in the Civil Rights Movement — it got me involved to run for the first place.  I didn’t realize that back in — when they — in Roosevelt’s term, when they were going to the fights whether unions could organize, they added a provision to the law that not many presidents paid attention to. And it says that if the Congress appropriates money for the president to spend on a public project or any project, that he must use an American worker and he must use American material. Folks, very few — very few lived by that.  Very few presidents did that. But not anymore.  That’s why we’re creating jobs.  (Applause.) Look, folks, you have lived and — and felt the decisions made decades ago. Today — today, we’re making decisions to transform your lives decades to come, and we’re doing it all across America. Let’s be clear: This groundbreaking investment comes from two historic laws that I signed with the support of Tammy and Gwen: my Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the most significant law modernizing our roads, bridges, and so much more in generations — the most consequential investment — (applause); and another law, the Inflation Reduction Act, which is the most significant investment in fighting climate change and advance the environment ever in history anywhere in the world.  That’s not hyperbole.  (Applause.) And — and they’re — they’re already making a difference. Look, let me give you just one example.  Back in December, I was in Milwaukee and met with a plumber named Rashawn, who owns — AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yes. THE PRESIDENT:  Is he here?  (Laughter.) All right — who owns his own small business, HERO Plumbing, that’s removing hundreds of pipes — lead pipes — so children and families in this community can turn on the faucet, clean water comes out without the risk of brain damage. Well, it was supposed to take the city 60 years to eliminate all these pipes, to do this work.  Because of the infrastructure law I signed, we’re now getting it done — all of it done — every lead pipe in this city, we’re — within 10 years, gone.  (Applause.) I was proud to have Rashawn as a guest at the State of the Union Address last week. And, folks, we’re on our way to delivering clean water to every American.  We’re on the way to delivering affordable high-speed Internet to every American at low cost. The communities too often left behind, we’re — we’re rebuilding.  We’re rebuilding the roads.  We’re filling in the cracks in the sidewalks.  We’re creating spaces to live and work and play safely and to breathe clean air and to shop at a nearby grocery, stocked with fresh and healthy food. We’re taking on housing discrimination, increasing access to homeownership, and building more homes and apartments to bring the cost of rent down (inaudible).  (Applause.) Everything we’re doing is connecting people with opportunity, not disconnecting people from opportunity.  And we’re seeing progress. Through my American Rescue Plan, we put $1,400 checks in people’s pockets to get them through the pandemic.  We invested nearly $80 million in Wisconsin for the State Small Business Credit Initiative, helping countless small businesses grow.  In Milwaukee, small business applications are up 70 percent compared to before the pandemic. Small businesses make up half of our economy.  We always talk to big corporations.  It’s true; they’re gigantic.  But if you add up all the small business in America, they make up half of all the gross domestic product, providing good-paying jobs and opportunities. And they’re — and everyone who applies for a small business — a new loan is an act of hope. And the share of Black and Latino Americans employed in Milwaukee in 2022 was the highest in more than a decade. And, folks — (applause) — wages are rising faster than prices. And now we have among the lowest inflation rates of any country inAmerica[the world], and still — we’re still fighting to lower it even further. We’re fighting to lower healthcare costs, education costs to give just a little more breathing room, as my dad would say, to ordinary families like the one I grew up in. But let’s be clear: My predecessor and ally — and his allies in Congress, including your senator, Ron Johnson, who voted a- — AUDIENCE:  Booo — THE PRESIDENT:  Well, he voted against the infrastructure law that funds this project.  They want to undo everything I just talked about. My predecessor talked about “Infrastructure Week” for four years.  He didn’t get a single thing done — not one. Ron Johnson and every Republican in Congress voted against the Inflation Reduction Act, which is helping fund these projects, and he want us to repeal it. Look, folks, with your help, we cut Black and Latino child poverty in half because of the Child Tax Credit through my American Rescue Plan.  (Applause.) Led by your senator, Ron Johnson, every single Republican in Congress voted against that as well — every single one. I signed a law to beat Big Pharma by giving Medicare the power to price prescription drugs and lower drug prices for seniors significantly.  Every Republican voted against it as well. And, by the way, guess what?  It lowered the federal deficit by $160 billion.  (Applause.) It didn’t just save money for seniors — it didn’t just save money for seniors; it meant Medicare didn’t have to pay out those exorbitant costs.  For example, those of you — you — everybody knows somebody who needs insulin for diabetes.  Well, guess what?  Just lowering the price to $35 — it only costs 10 bucks to make, by the way — instead of 400 bucks a month saved the government all that money. And now they’re trying to cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security.  Wisconsin’s very own senator, Ron Johnson, called Social Security — now, get this one; I’m amazed — he called Social Security a “Ponzi scheme.” No, I’m serious.  Think about it.  Did you ever think you’d hear anybody say that?  A Ponzi scheme?  Give me a break.  (Laughter.) You know, just this week Donald Trump said cuts to Social Security and Medicare are on the table.  When asked if he’d change his position, he said, quote, “There’s a lot we can do in terms of cutting.  Tremendous amount of things we can do,” end of quote. I want to assure you, I will never allow it to happen.  (Applause.) I won’t cut Social Security.  I will not cut Medicare. Instead of cutting Social Security and Medicare to give tax breaks to the super wealthy, I’m going to protect and strengthen Social Security and Medicare to make the wealthy begin pay their fair share.  (Applause.) Look, folks, let me close with this.  Four years ago this week, I came into office.  Our country was hit by the worst pandemic and economic crisis in a century.  Remember the fear and anxiety everybody felt?  Record job losses, a raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives.  And for every life lost, there expect- — there was estimated eight close family behind — eight — children, mother, father, uncles, aunts.  A mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness. A president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty any president owes to the American people: the duty to care — just to care.  (Applause.)  And in my view, that’s unforgivable. I came to office determined to uphold the duty that gets us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history.  And we have. And now we’re building a future of America full of possibilities; building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down — that top-down stuff, not a whole lot landed on my dad’s kitchen table growing up; investing in all America and all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot, where we leave nobody behind. Look, our plan is working, and America is coming back.  That’s America.  That’s what this project is all about — the projects for jobs and justice, prosperity, and unlimited possibilities. And that’s why, I swear to God, I’ve never been more optimistic about America’s future than I am today.  Not because I’m president; because we’re at one of those inflection points in history.  We really are. Things are going to change, no matter who’s president, in a big way.  They’re either going to change much for the better or much worse. All we have to do, folks, is remember who in God’s name we are.  We’re the United States of America.  (Applause.)  No — we’re the only major country in the world that’s come out of every crisis stronger than we went in — stronger than we went in. There is nothing beyond our capacity.  I mean it sincerely.  Think about it.  There’s nothing beyond America’s capacity if we do it together.  And that’s what we’re going to do. May God bless you all.  And may God protect our troops. Thank you so much.  (Applause.) Thank you, thank you, thank you. 3:54 P.M.

                "text_body": "Former PresidentDonald Trumpon Monday suggested he was open to making cuts to Social Security and Medicare after opposing touching the entitlement programs and attacking his GOP presidential primary rivals over the issue. Trump was asked inan interview with CNBCwhether he had changed his outlook on how to handle entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid in order to tackle the national debt. “There is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,” Trump said on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” He added: “There’s tremendous amounts of things and numbers of things you can do.” Following the interview, President Joe Biden responded to a clip his campaign made of Trump’s comments: “Not on my watch.” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt later told CNN that Trump was “clearly talking about cutting waste, not entitlements.” “President Trump delivered on his promise to protect Social Security and Medicare in his first term, and President Trump will continue to strongly protect Social Security and Medicare in his second term,” said Leavitt, who argued: “The only candidate who poses a threat to Social Security and Medicare is Joe Biden.” Related article15 promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term “By unleashing American energy, slashing job-killing regulations, and adopting pro-growth America First tax and trade policies, President Trump will quickly rebuild the greatest economy in history and put Social Security and Medicare on a stronger footing for generations to come,” Leavitt said. When Trump was president, his administration’s budget proposals included spending cuts to Social Security, primarily by targeting disability benefits, and Medicare, largely by reducing provider payments. Trump also signaled in an interview with CNBC in 2020 that he was open to cutting federal entitlements to reduce the federal deficit. But Trump has vowed repeatedly on the campaign trail this election cycle to “always defend Medicare and Social Security,” and has a video posted to his campaign website in which he says, “Under no circumstances should Republicans vote to cut a single penny from Medicare or Social Security.” “We don’t have to play around with Social Security and Medicare,” Trump said at a campaign rally in Michigan last month. Trump also fiercely attacked former GOP rival Nikki Haley on the campaign trail over her support for reforming these entitlement programs. Haley called for increasing the age at which today’s younger workers would become eligible for Social Security retirement benefits and limiting the benefits of wealthier Americans. Trump also regularly took aim at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over his past support of privatizing Social Security and raising the retirement age – positions the governor distanced himself from during his failed presidential bid. The Biden administration has sought to contrast the president’s support of Social Security and Medicare with Republicans’ proposals to address shortfalls in the programs’ finances. In his State of the Union address last week, Biden said he would stop anyone who tries to cut the programs or raise the retirement age. Without any changes,Social Security’s combined trust fundsare set to run dry in 2034, at which time the program’s continuing income from taxes will only be able to cover 80% of benefits owed, according the most recent Social Security trustees report. Medicare’s hospital insurance trust fund, known as Medicare Part A, will only be able to pay scheduled benefits in full until 2031, according to the latest Medicare trustees’ annual report. At that time, Medicare, which covers nearly 67 million senior citizens and people with disabilities, will only be able to cover 89% of total scheduled benefits. Two factors driving the projected rise in deficits are the aging population and the growth in federal health care costs, which will necessitate greater spending on Social Security and Medicare, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Trump has been more open to cutting Medicaid enrollment and reducing federal funding for the program, which provides health coverage to low-income Americans. His administration approved requests from several states to require certain enrollees to work, which resulted in thousands of people losing coverage in Arkansas, the only state that implemented it for a short time before being stopped in federal court. And as part of the 2017 efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Republicans wanted to curtail the amount offuture federal supportfor Medicaid by sending a fixed amount of money to the states each year and reducing the growth rate of that funding. Additionally, they wanted to jettison the Obamacare program that expands Medicaid coverage to low-income adults. Also in the Monday interview with CNBC, Trump said it was a “tough decision” on whether the US should ban TikTok and argued getting rid of the app would benefit Facebook. “The thing I don’t like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger, and I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people along with a lot of the media,” Trump said, adding he thought “Facebook has been very bad for our country, especially when it comes to elections.” Trump said he thought TikTok posed a national security threat to the US but said “you have that problem with Facebook and lots of other companies too,” and said, “there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it.” “There’s, you know, a lot of good, and there’s a lot of bad with TikTok,” Trump said. His comments come days after a House committee unanimously advanced a bill that could lead to a nationwide ban against TikTok on all electronic devices. The measure, which was approved by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, would prohibit TikTok from US app stores unless the social media platform is quickly spun off from its China-linked parent company, ByteDance. TikTok is one of the world’s most popular social media apps and is used by roughly 170 million Americans. When Trump was president, he supported calls to ban the app, but has since appeared to have backed away from that stance. Trump was asked by CNBC about his change in position on TikTok and whether there was any connection to his recent meeting with Jeff Yass, a top GOP donor and major TikTok investor. Trump said he did not discuss TikTok with Yass, and said he met with Yass and his wife for only “a few minutes,” and that Yass “never mentioned TikTok.” Trump said when he was president, he wanted Congress to decide whether TikTok should be banned. “I was at the point where I could have gotten it done if I wanted to,” Trump said. “I sort of said, you guys decide, you make that decision because it’s a tough decision to make.” Trump also said in the Monday interview that imposing tariffs “gives you power in dealing with other countries,” and said, “I’m a big believer in tariffs.” “Tariffs are tremendously powerful in terms of stopping wars because they don’t want tariffs. And frankly, I can, I made them sing, I made other countries sing with the threat of tariffs. And if you don’t have tariffs, we have nothing whatsoever on them,” Trump said. Trump said last month he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he regains the presidency. As president, Trump imposed tariffs of 25% on $50 billion of Chinese goods in June 2018. Beijing countered with its own tariffs, and the spiral continued until the two countries arrived at an agreement in 2020. The Biden administration has largely kept the Trump-era tariffs in place. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

                "text_body": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — When former President Donald Trumpsaidlast weekon CNBC that “there’s a lot you can do in terms of entitlements, in terms of cutting,” itsparked an immediate outcryfrom President Joe Biden and began a battle over retirement programs that is likely to persist through the 2024 election. Trump sought to clean it up,saying in an interviewwith the conservative website Breitbart, “I will never do anything that will jeopardize or hurt Social Security or Medicare.” Biden campaign spokesman James Singer accused Trump of trying to “trick voters,” saying, “Donald Trump tried cutting Social Security and Medicare by billions of dollars every single year he was in office.” At the heart of the debate is the ticking clock: Actuaries say Medicare is solvent until 2028, while Social Security is solvent until 2033. After that, benefits will be forcibly cut unless more revenues are added. Biden’s new budget calls for tax hikes on upper earners to maintain the benefits. Trump hasn’t said how he would address the shortfall, leaving it an open question. His campaign didn't elaborate when it was asked multiple times to comment. So what is Trump’s real record on Social Security and Medicare? An NBC News examination found that his views have zigzagged over the years — from calling Social Security a “Ponzi scheme” in 2000 to endorsing then-Rep. Paul Ryan’s plans to restructure Medicare in 2012 to positioning himself as the protector of those programs in 2016 to taking aim at some retirement spending in his White House budgets (which never became law). In a 2000 book he co-wrote called “The America We Deserve,” Trump called Social Security a “huge Ponzi scheme” that American workers are forced to pay into. He added that for future retirees under 40 at the time, “we can also raise the age for receipt of full Social Security benefits to seventy,” because “we’re living longer.” In December 2004, just before a Republican push to partially privatize the program, Trump was asked on MSNBC’s “Hardball” whether he’d support individual retirement accounts andanswered: “I sort of think I would. Something has to be done. Social Security is a huge problem right now, funding it.” In 2012, Trump praised proposals by Ryan, then the Republican vice presidential nominee, to convert Medicare into a “premium support” system that would cap spending for future retirees and give them vouchers to buy insurance plans. “I think Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney will save Medicare. I know they will. And people are starting to understand it. They’re going to be very happy with what’s going on, but they’re going to be very, very unhappy if Obama gets in,” Trumptold Fox Newsat the time, reflecting on the 2012 presidential race. “I think actually if Obama gets in and if Obamacare isn’t ended, I really think Medicare will be a thing of the past.” (President Barack Obama ran against the Ryan plan and won re-election; seven years after he left office, Obamacare and Medicare still exist.) By 2015, when Trump ran for president, he sought to position himself in the Republican field as the rare candidate who wouldn’t cut those programs. “I’m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I’m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid,”he saidas he was launching his campaign. The Biden campaign’s claim that Trump sought to cut spending under Social Security and Medicare in office has merit, but it omits some key context. Trump’sfiscal 2021 budgetendorsed Social Security cuts to the tune of billions of dollars for disabled seniors. His budget would have made changes to Social Security Disability Insurance, slashing the maximum amount of retroactive benefits for disabled workers from 12 months to six. According to the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, thatcould lead toa $7,500 average cut for a worker injured in a car crash. The budget also called for reducing Supplemental Security Income benefits for those who live with other SSI recipients. When it comes to Medicare, Trump’s White House budgets didn’t call for benefit cuts. His fiscal 2020 blueprint called for Medicare changes to lower payments to providers and suppliers through new incentives and a lower inflation benchmark. Biden and Democrats embraced the same types of “cuts” under Obamacare, which extended the solvency of Medicare by lowering payments to hospitals and insurers, in exchange for more customers. Trump's budgets also put an emphasis on saving money by cutting waste and fraud, but they were vague about how. Still, he never pushed Congress to act, and his plans didn't become law. As president, Trump also signaled, when asked, thathe’d be open to changing or “cutting” the programs in a second term. Asked on CNBC in January 2020 whether entitlements would ever “be on your plate,”he said, “At some point they will be.” He added: “At the right time, we will take a look at that. You know, that’s actually the easiest of all things.” He didn’t get specific. At a March 2020 Fox News town hall, pressed about the need to cut “entitlements” to reduce the debt,Trump responded: “Oh, we’ll be cutting, but we’re also going to have growth like you’ve never had before.” On Medicaid, however, Trump quickly abandoned his promise to oppose benefit cuts. He made a vigorous push to repeal Obamacare in 2017, which would have rolled back Medicaid coverage for millions of people. The repeal push fell short in Congress, and Trump recentlyrevived his calls to “terminate” Obamacare. Running for a second term, Trump picked up where he began in 2016, attacking Republican primary rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley for having supported cuts in retirement benefits. But he hasn’t laid out his own 2024 plan or given any indication that he’d break from GOP orthodoxy by raising taxes to finance the programs. A Trump campaign spokesperson didn’t directly respond when asked to explain how he would keep Social Security and Medicare solvent or whether new tax revenues would be on the table for him to prevent benefit cuts. On CNBC last week, Trump said there’s “tremendous bad management of entitlements” and “tremendous amounts of things and numbers of things you can do,” without specifying them. In a statement walking back his openness to “cutting” the programs, the Trump campaign’s national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Biden is the “only candidate” who threatens them, claiming that “millions of illegal aliens” in the U.S. will cause “Social Security and Medicare to buckle and collapse.” She said Trump will “quickly rebuild the greatest economy in history and put Social Security and Medicare on a stronger footing for generations to come.” However, immigrants who are in the country illegallyaren’t eligiblefor Social Security and Medicare benefits. The Social Security actuary has said unauthorized workers have “a positive effect on the financial status of the Social Security program.” In 2010, for instance, it estimated they delivered a net surplus of$12 billionin tax revenues into the program.

                "text_body": "Former President Donald Trumphas calledhis 2024 opponent Ron DeSantis a “wheelchair over the cliff kind of guy” for supporting then-Rep. Paul Ryan’s 2012 plans to partially privatize Medicare but a review of Trump’s comments by CNN’s KFile shows that he supported the same plan at the same time. Trump’s comment gives a nod to the infamous ad against Ryan from a progressive group where a Paul Ryan look-alike actor literally threw a grandma in a wheelchair over a cliff while a narrator in the ad attacked his record on entitlements. DeSantis’ past congressional votes and supportfor the privatizationof Medicare and Social Security are one of Trump’smost commonattacks on the Florida governor, whohas since distancedhimself from his past support for privatization. However, the former president enthusiastically supported the same plan, which would have partially privatized the program and critics argued turned it into a voucher system. At the time, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney had selected Ryan as his running mate, putting Ryan’s controversial plans for entitlements front and center in the campaign. Trump argued the plan would actually strengthen the program in the end. “In fact, it’s probably going to be better. And you’re gonna have a stronger system,” Trumpsaidin August 2012 during an appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” In a review of dozens of appearances from Trump on Fox News and CNBC after the pick of Ryan in 2012 – Trump did not criticize Ryan’s plan and only spoke positively about the congressman. Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson emphasized in an email to CNN that Trump wasn’t a candidate at that time. “President Trump wasn’t a candidate or an elected official then,” he told CNN. “When President Trump was elected and went to Washington, DC, he saw just how weak and incompetent Paul Ryan was, and prevented his disastrous ideas like cutting social security and Medicare from coming to fruition.” Democratsargued in 2012that Ryan’s budget plans would turn Medicare into a “voucher” system, whereas Republicans called it “premium support.” Under the proposals, the government would subsidize seniors by partially paying for private plans or a traditional Medicare plan. CNN’s KFile previouslyreportedthat more than 20 years ago Trump backed raising the retirement age to 70 and privatizing Social Security – two positions he has since come out against. Speaking on CNBC, where he made weekly appearances at the time, Trump said Republicans would need to market the details of the plan to win over voters. “You’re going to have to really market what that plan is,” Trumpadded. “And that plan is a positive thing for the country. But it’s a hard one to market. You’ret going to have to say that Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, all of this is going to be much stronger at the end. It doesn’t affect people over 55. And even if you’re 23 years old, you have the right to stay on Medicare, right?” “He wants to save Medicare,” Trump added a week later on Fox and Friends. And despite his recent very similar attacks on DeSantis, Trump argued in 2012 on CNBC that Democrats were engaging in demagoguery. “These things are gonna have to come out. And you know, unfortunately, you talk about demagogue, they’re demagoguing to a point where it’s almost like Medicare - everything’s gonna be taken away from you,” said Trump. “You’re gonna be destroyed, you’re gonna live in the streets. That’s hard to counter, but the Republicans are gonna have to counter it.” “I would have maybe done some of the things they did, but I would’ve done it after the election,” Trump said. “Not before the election. I thought the timing was inappropriate.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

Trump has long sought to distance himself from other Republicans by pledging fidelity to entitlement programs. | Jamie Kelter Davis for POLITICO BySam Stein 03/14/2024 09:09 AM EDT Link Copied Former President Donald Trump is cleaning up comments he made last week, in which he seemingly entertained the idea of cutting Social Security. In an interview with Breitbart News, published on Thursday, Trump insisted he would not touch the social insurance program, nor would he pursue cuts to Medicare. “I will never do anything that will jeopardize or hurt Social Security or Medicare,”Trump told the site. “We’ll have to do it elsewhere. But we’re not going to do anything to hurt them.” Trump has long sought to distance himself from other Republicans by pledging fidelity to entitlement programs, convinced that they present a huge political tripwire for his party. He criticized then-Rep. Paul Ryan during the Barack Obama era for pushing austerity budgets. And this year he urged Republicans not to demand entitlement reforms in exchange for lifting the nation’s debt ceiling. But in an interview with CNBC last week, he was pressed as to whether he’d revisit that position. “So first of all, there is a lot you can do in terms of entitlements — in terms of cutting — and in terms of also the theft and the bad management of entitlements,” he replied. The Biden campaign immediately jumped on the remarks as proof that Trump had opened the door to slashing Social Security. The president criticized Trump at an event hours after the CNBC interview aired. And he is expected to do the same at a rally in Michigan on Thursday.  © 2024 POLITICO LLC"

Let‘s play HARDBALL. Good evening.  I‘m Chris Matthews.  One year ago, Saddam Hussein, one of the hunted men in the world, was captured.  Here‘s how Paul Bremer, then the top U.S. administrator in Iraq, told the world. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) PAUL BREMER, U.S. ADMINISTRATOR IN IRAQ:  Ladies and gentlemen, we got him. (END VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEWS:  One year later, Saddam Hussein remains in captivity and is awaiting trial.  How far have we come on the road to a peaceful Iraq? Here now is General Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of Operation Desert Storm.  General Schwarzkopf, are we on schedule in Iraq in winning this war? GEN. NORMAN SCHWARZKOPF, RET, U.S. ARMY:  I think, you know, in the final analysis, we are behind where we thought we would be at this time. MATTHEWS:  Why? SCHWARZKOPF:  Well, I think that we felt that once Saddam Hussein was captured and the two sons were killed, that the loyalists would sort of fold their tent and creep away, and we‘d get about the business of rebuilding downtown Baghdad and some of the other places.  But just the opposite happened.  Plus, we hadn‘t counted on it turning into jihad.  And once it turned into jihad, you had all these foreign troops coming in from all over the place, the terrorists, and of course, they are the ones that are wreaking havoc these days. MATTHEWS:  Why did we not expect that the Iraqi people would resist occupation? SCHWARZKOPF:  Well, I think that there was, you know, from the very beginning of the campaign, there was an assumption that the Iraqi people were just waiting for us to get there.  Remember at one point, somebody said they would be strewing flowers in our path as we came into Baghdad. MATTHEWS:  Right. SCHWARZKOPF:  I mean, showed a total lack of understanding of the culture that we were dealing with. MATTHEWS:  Who is responsible for that misinformation for our troops and for our strategy?  Is it the Defense Department civilians? SCHWARZKOPF:  Yes.  I think that you have to put the blame there to begin with, and they, you know, obviously they were driving the train as far as intelligence apparatus and the information we were getting and that sort of thing. MATTHEWS:  Those intellectuals, those ideologues in the Department of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz, Doug Feith, et cetera, et cetera, have they learned their lesson?  Have they sent the message to the generals saying, you know what, we had this all wrong, it‘s actually our country against their country, it‘s not just simply us against Saddam Hussein? SCHWARZKOPF:  I‘ve got to tell you, my experience is, those people don‘t back down very much and take the blame themselves. MATTHEWS:  Well, has it informed—now that we know that we‘re facing something of an insurgency, whether it‘s fueled by outside agitators or it‘s fueled by nationalism, or it‘s fueled by the old regime that simply wants to resist the takeover by the democratic forces of the Shia, who will probably win the election, how have we changed our strategy as you know, as in terms of dealing with this unexpected resistance? SCHWARZKOPF:  Well, initially, of course, when the invasion took place, it was a classic military operation, and was very easy to handle.  But now that we‘re into the house-to-house fighting, fighting against an enemy that is very elusive, very, very hard to identify, and at the same time, you know, you‘re destroying families‘ homes and that sort of thing.  So it‘s a very—it‘s the toughest, as I‘ve said in the very beginning and I‘ve said over and over again, combat in cities is the toughest type of battle that you are going to fight.  You‘re going to take a lot of casualties, and unfortunately you‘re going to see a lot of civilian casualties also.  And when you couple that with the religious fanatics, then you‘ve really got a problem on your hands. MATTHEWS:  Let‘s talk about equipment and weaponry and armor.  Back when you fought and won the Persian Gulf War in 1991, did you ever have a deficiency in your preparation in terms of equipment, armor, weaponry, whatever? SCHWARZKOPF:  Initially, initially when I said I needed—told people what I needed, they said, oh, no, you don‘t need that much, and there was a lot of second-guessing.  Finally, Colin Powell, I prevailed on Colin and Colin set the record straight as far as Washington, D.C. was concerned, and from that point forward I had everything that I needed to make sure that we had a great victory. MATTHEWS:  What do you make of the service people‘s complaints last week to the, especially that one fellow from Tennessee, to the secretary of defense, saying that the military, the Marines and the Army, are denied the armor protection they need on those vehicles? SCHWARZKOPF:  Well, you know, the humvee was never considered an armored vehicle to begin with.  So the system they‘ve come up with is a jerry-rigged system which really doesn‘t give you much protection when you‘re going against—you know, being blown from a bump—a mine on a side of a road or something of that sort. But they deserve every bit of protection that we can give them.  Absolutely.  And I was very, very disappointed—let me put it stronger, I was angry about the words of the secretary of defense when he laid it all on the Army.  I mean, as if he as the secretary of defense didn‘t have anything to do with the Army, if the Army was over there doing it themselves screwing up. MATTHEWS:  It‘s funny because you know, when you look at history, and you‘re an expert on military history, General, you look at the Germans and certainly the French before them under Napoleon, when they went into Russia, they had the wrong clothing, they didn‘t know they were going to be fighting a winter war.  Here, it seems like the Americans‘ troops weren‘t aware what kind of a battle they were going to be fighting, and that was a problem not of the troops, but of the leadership, isn‘t it? SCHWARZKOPF:  Well, I think in the initial battle, pretty well unfolded the way we considered it would be, and it was a classic military operation.  It was only after the fact that things have gone awry.  And I think we‘re there with a whole lot more equipment than we thought we‘d be there.  That equipment is really—you know, people think of sand, they think of a beach here, but it‘s not that way.  It‘s a very, very fine powder.  And it gets into everything, and particularly into motors and aircraft, and that sort of thing.  And it‘s very, very hard to put up with that just to begin with. MATTHEWS:  Let me ask you about troop morale.  You do keep contact, I know, because we‘ve talked to—and obviously you‘re a military man and your friendships are probably all kinds of networks that go through the military.  What do you hear about morale?  Let‘s go from the officer—officers on down, and up through the enlisted ranks.  What‘s the mood of the men fighting and women fighting that war over there right now in Iraq?  And we lost eight more people this weekend, I noticed. SCHWARZKOPF:  Yeah.  The mood is very professional among the regular Army, and the regular Air Force and the regular Navy.  I mean, they have got a job to do, they know how to do the job, and they‘re in the process of executing that.  They‘re taking casualties, and they never expected to do their job without casualties, but what they‘re trying to do is do their job and minimize the casualties at the same time.  So it‘s strictly sort of a professionalism that they knew what they signed up for when they came in, and when they stuck around, they knew what to expect.  And they‘re going to do their job and they‘re going to do it very, very well. Of course, the other side of the soldier is the reservist.  And that‘s a different story, because these are people who really are not adequately trained to go right into battle.  The concept has always been that you would activate the reserves, and then those units that needed additional training would get that additional training before they were thrown into the battle. MATTHEWS:  What about the National Guard people and the reservists now?  According to numbers we‘re looking at, they suffer about a third more KIAs than the regular Army.  Is that a result of the fact they‘re not prepared, they‘re getting killed more frequently than the regular guys are? SCHWARZKOPF:  Well, I think there‘s a couple of things.  Number one— I think it‘s kind of premature to start comparing numbers against numbers at this time, the casualty county, although it is there, it‘s extremely small compared to what it could be.  So I think it‘s too early to make judgments along that way, but on the other hand, you know, I think that the concept has always been that they would train before they would go into battle, train as units, and that was expected to happen. So I think that it‘s sort of unfair to now be complaining about the fact that they are being thrown into the battlefield more so. The other thing is you‘ve got to consider the type of missions that they have.  You know, most of the transportation organizations over there are reserve component organizations, and they‘re the ones that are getting blown up along the side of the roads, so they have—they‘re facing a tough challenge that they haven‘t had to face before. MATTHEWS:  Do you think we‘re making proper use, or we‘re overusing or abusing the reservists in this war? SCHWARZKOPF:  Oh, I think we‘re making proper use.  I don‘t think we‘re overloading them.  I don‘t think we‘re abusing them, and I think you‘re going to—if you were over there, I‘d think you‘d find an awful lot of reserve component units who are very proud of what they‘re doing, and that, you know, that speaks well for them. MATTHEWS:  Well, it‘s great to have you on.  Merry Christmas, General. SCHWARZKOPF:  Thank you. MATTHEWS:  General Norman Schwarzkopf, thank you for joining us. Coming up, doctors for the top opposition candidate in the Ukraine say he was poisoned with dioxin.  Former ambassador to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, is just back from the Ukraine, and he‘ll be our guest when we return. And later, Donald Trump.  You‘re watching HARDBALL, only on MSNBC. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTHEWS:  Welcome back to HARDBALL.  If this story sounds like the plot from a John (UNINTELLIGIBLE) novel, you‘re right except this is real.  A Ukrainian presidential candidate, the one not backed by Russia‘s leader Vladimir Putin was poisoned as he ran for president.  By whom we don‘t know but the intrigue grows by the day. Former U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Richard Holbrooke has just returned from Ukraine.  Do you think this man was actually poisoned, the opposition candidate? RICHARD HOLBROOKE, FMR. AMBASSADOR TO THE U.N.:  There‘s no doubt.  Look at the photographs, Chris.  In July he was a Hollywood movie star handsome guy.  His face started falling apart.  He—it‘s pock-marked and gray now.  He was clearly poisoned.  The Viennese doctors failed to find it right away.  It‘s dioxin.  And the only question is whodunnit? I was in Ukraine yesterday and I can tell you that the suspicions are running high that it somehow has something to do with the KGB and the Russians.  But there is no proof of that. MATTHEWS:  The suspicion now runs—merely the suspicion that it comes from the Russians not from the preferred candidate of the incumbent president of Ukraine? HOLBROOKE:  That‘s the suspicion but nobody knows.  The important thing is that on December 26 there will be another runoff.  Viktor Yushchenko, the poisoned man, the man whom Moscow opposes, is going to win.  It is a historic moment for Ukraine and Europe.  Ukraine as we all learned in high school and college, Ukraine and Russia were one single history.  It turns out the Ukrainians didn‘t see it that way.  They have always sought full independence.  They left the Soviet Union 12 years ago.  That was a sort of halfway house.  Now they‘re going to really break Moscow.  It‘s a dramatic and historic event. MATTHEWS:  I went to school with a lot of Ukrainians in Philadelphia.  And since a lot of them were—frankly all of them were Roman Catholic, I got to know a lot of them.  Has this been a long-standing sentiment of the Ukrainian people to break from mother Russia? HOLBROOKE:  Yes, it has been but your Ukrainian high school friends knew something that we were not taught in college, which was there was a separate Ukrainian identity. By the way, Chris, I brought with me to show you two pieces of propaganda which I‘d like to show you which were put out by the government forces and which everyone in Moscow—every one in Kiev thought had been put out by the Russians. The first one is a photograph put out by the government forces showing President Bush and Viktor Yushchenko, the candidate who was poisoned.  This is obviously a combination of Bush‘s face and Yushchenko‘s face.  The Yushchenko part of the face before he was poisoned.  And this is to suggest to the Ukrainian people that he is an American puppet.  The second is Bush actually holding Yushchenko as a puppet.  And underneath it it says, “Here is our president.”  And they‘ve crossed out the “P”, you see the red mark over the “p” in president so that it says here is our resident.  And of course all people in the former Soviet Union know that resident means KGB  chief. So this is the kind of stuff that‘s been put out over the last few months.  But the really dramatic thing is that the streets of Kiev have been taken over by young idealistic demonstrators who are occupying the streets.  They have a tent city.  I visited them.  I sat with them in their tents.  The tents have been put up by the Ukrainian army.  The electricity and the heating in the tents because it‘s cold in Ukraine in winter is given by the mayor who defected from the government that appointed him and these kids are going to sit in the center of Ukraine right through December 26 and beyond until Yushchenko becomes president. The chance to do what the Chinese did at Tiananmen Square, crackdown has gone, the government can‘t use force.  The supreme irony to me was while the center of Kiev was occupied by these demonstrators, and MSNBC is show them very effectively in your news coverage, there was President Kuczma (ph), the virtual strongman controlling Ukraine, trapped in a villa on the suburbs of Kiev because he can‘t get into his regular office from which he ruled Ukraine for 10 years.  So what we‘re seeing, Chris, is one of the great events in the history of modern Europe.  Ukraine, after 1,000 years, is just days from a full, final declaration of independence from Russia.  It‘s quite something. MATTHEWS:  I‘m trying to put it in line with the other apocryphal events of the end of the Cold War.  One was the failure of the Warsaw Pact tanks to move when the government in Hungary basically opened up the Iron Curtain.  The other I guess was in 1991 when Yeltsin stood down the tanks of the Red Army. HOLBROOKE:  And the fall of the Berlin Wall. MATTHEWS:  Right.  That went in between.  And you put this one in that category of important events? HOLBROOKE:  If as I believe will happen on December 26, Viktor Yushchenko will become the new president of the Ukraine.  It is a stunning event.  And the biggest loser here is Vladimir Putin.  He has had a terrible year, an anus horribleous (ph), to quote Queen Elizabeth in another context. He lost Georgia in March.  He‘s had the Beslan school tragedy.  He‘s had this drama with (UNINTELLIGIBLE), he‘s cracked down on the press, he is losing his friends.  President Bush is going to have to re-evaluate the four-year love affair he had with Putin because he‘s gotten nothing from it and now Putin, as these things I showed show, the Russians are accusing Bush of running this election.  So I think what you‘re going to see here is a very dramatic set of events.  Putin is isolated, he‘s angry, he‘s lashing out at the west.  We‘re going to have to back Yushchenko.  My own personal view is we should encourage Ukraine to join NATO which would be something you and I could never have imagined a few years ago. MATTHEWS:  How would you gauge President Bush‘s performance?  Has he been too restrained or well advised to be restrained in terms of U.S.  participation in this Ukrainian fight for freedom? HOLBROOKE:  He‘s been criticized by the press but there is a method to what he‘s doing.  He is trying not to attack Putin directly, far less than the Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin in that joint press conference.  Martin lashed out at Putin, Bush did not. But his missions, his embassy, Secretary Powell, have been very firm on this so I am not prepared to criticize President Bush right now.  The real test will come after Yushchenko takes over.  Are we going to invite him to Washington right away?  By the way, his wife is like your high school friends.  She‘s a Ukrainian-American from Chicago. Will Bush invite Yushchenko to Washington right away, will he address the joint session of Congress, my guess is he will.  It will be very dramatic.  And then finally will we encourage them to join NATO and will we re-evaluate our relationship with Putin?  We don‘t want to have a new Cold War.  I can‘t stress that highly enough.  And Ukraine has to get along well with Russia, its giant neighbor which controls a lot of its economy.  But on the other hand, Ukraine after 1,000 years in Russian airspace, wants to look to the west and we should encourage it. MATTHEWS:  Thanks very much.  Richard Holbrooke, former United States ambassador to the United Nations. Up next, he‘s about to tell one you‘re fired and the other you‘re hired.  Donald Trump joins us.  You‘re watching HARDBALL on MSNBC. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTHEWS:  Welcome back to HARDBALL. This Thursday, the season the season fine aisle of “The Apprentice” will air on NBC.  Donald Trump is the star of “The Apprentice” and he joins us now from New York.  Donald, thank you for joining us.  Good luck with Thursday night. Let me ask you this, what do you think has been the impact of “The Apprentice” on this country? DONALD TRUMP, “THE APPRENTICE”:  Well, people are starting to understand business a little bit better, they‘re liking business, they‘re even liking me better than they used to.  You know, I used to have this reputation which I think was a little bit incorrect.  They were actually thinking—I mean, it‘s pretty sad—I fire people all the time and people think I‘m a nicer person than I used to be.  But they really are getting business and they‘re learning something.  That‘s why, as you know, the ratings came out recently, and in the younger groups in particular we‘re no. 1.  And it‘s doing great all over the place, but from number I guess 18 to 35, we‘re the number one show on television.  So, it‘s really been amazing. MATTHEWS:  You know, when I was growing up and I was college age, everybody was against making money.  Going to law school was like going to shop.  Nobody went to B-school.  Everybody wanted to major in psyche or political science or philosophy or something like that because it was the 60s. Are kids now openly interested in making loot, making big money? TRUMP:  Well, I think, that‘s be one of the advantages to “The Apprentice” and what‘s it‘s done even in terms of the economy and the society—you know, it‘s a good thing.  It‘s not a bad thing.  They want to do something.  They want to be productive.  And certainly the people on “The Apprentice” have been very productive.  And you know, who would have ever thought, Chris, when you and I first did our interview a year ago, before season one went on the air, who would have ever thought it would have turned out to be this big monster? Now, as you know on Thursday night, we have three hour grand finale.  And of all things, it‘s three hours live.  So, I‘m going to be doing live television for almost three hours, something I‘m not particularly looking forward to, but we‘ll give it a shot. MATTHEWS:  Well, is it because people like the crackling reality of winning and losing. TRUMP:  Well, I think it‘s wining and losing.  I think it‘s business.  I think, for whatever reason, they probably like me or hate me or something.  It‘s like Howard Cosell, you loved him or you hated him, but you watched.  And certainly it‘s the city.  I mean, it‘s New York City.  It‘s a postcard to New York City.  It‘s a love letter to New York City.  The cinematography is amazing.  Mark Burnett‘s done a great and his people J.B. and Stock (ph) and everybody else.  It‘s just been an amazing thing that we‘re all involved with.  Who would have thought this would have happened.  When we were sitting with you, you remember I told you, “I‘m going to do it.  We‘re going to have some fun.”  Well, I did it.  WE had some fun and the show went to no. 1. So, who would have thought that Chris. MATTHEWS:  So, this is HARDBALL Donald, so let me tell you.  I‘m going to ask you the question, what‘s the difference between you, and I think you are more popular than you were a year ago, and I think you‘ve always pretty much been a popular figure, but let me ask, what‘s the difference between you and Gordon Gecko, the character that Michael Douglas played in “Wall Street,” in that Oliver Stone movie all those years ago? Why is are you popular, and he was sorted of hated. TRUMP:  Well, I think Michael used to say, and Michael is a good friend of mine, he‘s a golfing friend of mine.  He used to say that he studied me when he did Gordon Gecko.  And I wasn‘t sure, is that nice or that not so good. MATTHEWS:  It didn‘t come out nice. TRUMP:  No.  No.  It didn‘t come out.   Gordon Gecko wasn‘t the nicest of guys.  I think I‘m a nice guy.  I mean, I get along with people.  I have great relationships.  I have a lot of wonderful relationships.  And even in business, I have a lot of wonderful relationships. Gordon Gecko was not big into the world of relationships. MATTHEWS:  Is greed good? TRUMP:  No.  Greed is bad.  Greed is not good.  I do it for fun.  I love doing it.  I love what I‘m doing.  The expression they used in the movie, “greed is good,” was incredible expression.  It was great for purposes of a movie, but greed is certainly not good. MATTHEWS:  Let me ask you about Donald Trump the character that‘s coming up.  Because there is a character you play in “The Apprentice.” It‘s a tough guy.  It‘s no nonsense.  It‘s all business.  And there‘s also a kind of a crisp decisiveness where you sit there ago, sorry, buddy, I‘m the arbiter.  I‘m the judge in this court, there ain‘t no jury here. Is that how you are in business? TRUMP:  Well, I think so.  I think, it‘s very much a reflection of how I am and how business is.  How the real world is.  I mean, we see some of these people.  You watch for instance, the other night, Andy got fired.  and the wormed is.  you watch some of these people.  Andy got fired.  Andy when to Harvard, he was national debating champion, and yet two women beat the hell out of him in debating.  They just beat him up.  I don‘t know if you got to see that one, but he just got beaten up very badly.  And people are amazed.  I mean, you have this great debating champion, really smart guy, and two women just took him to the cleaners.  So you never know how it‘s going to come out.  But the fact is, it is a reflection on, not only me, but on business in general. MATTHEWS:  Somebody said the other day that the future is going to be dominated by people with MFA degrees in design, because so much of the business (UNINTELLIGIBLE), the mathematics of business is now calculated by computers.  Do you even see any sense of that, that people want original thinking, rather than the kind of old style business calculation. TRUMP:  Well, old style will never change, and I really think you need them both.  And it‘s very interesting to see what.  You know, as an example, we had over a million people apply to be on “The Apprentice” for the second season, which is a record on television history.  So, over a million people came in.  And I‘m telling you Chris, once they get there, they all want to be businessmen.  But once they get there, they want to be movie stores.  So, it‘s sort of interesting. MATTHEWS:  When you look at the best business schools in the country, the best B-schools, Wharton, Harvard, et cetera.  Do you think they‘re better—turning out better people, than the colleges of hard knocks, the people coming from the schools that aren‘t so highly prized, but have better moxie? What do you see out there?  Do the big B-schools still attract and produce the best people. TRUMP:  Well, I went to Wharton.  And if you go to Wharton or Harvard or Stanford or any of the great ones you, it means you have a good brain to start off with.  And you know, it‘s something.  But honestly I‘m not sure there‘s a huge advantage.  I‘ve seen, and on “The Apprentice” we show this.  And in fact, as you know, we showed those with education, really great education and those without.  And frankly the people without the education in some cases do better. MATTHEWS:  Yes, that‘s why... TRUMP:  But I‘m a big believer in education, I want to stress that.  But in many cases, on many tasks, the young, very ambitious and also very successful—because the deal was you could either be highly educated or you had to highly successful without the education.  And some of these people without the education have done very, very well. MATTHEWS:  I want ask you when we come back, first question.  I‘m going to ask you a lot of politics.  But I want to ask you first question, does the wild kid, the sort of the out of the box kid, more attractive to the business manager like yourself today, than the straight-arrow student who did everything right in business school. I‘ll be right back with more with Donald Trump and his wisdom.  You‘re watching HARDBALL. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTHEWS:  Welcome back to HARDBALL.  We‘re back with Donald Trump.  And “The Apprentice” has its season finale this Thursday night.  And it‘s all live.  And Donald Trump is excited about that. Let me ask you, sir, about, if you had to choose between—in general, speaking between a kind of a geek, a real wild, far-out sort of computer guy that is one of today‘s kind of people, or a straight business school type who did everything right and got high grades, who would you like? TRUMP:  I think I would be inclined to go with the business school type that got good high grades with a great education.  That‘s my bias.  That doesn‘t mean you can‘t have be successful the other way. If you look at “The Apprentice,” Troy, as an example, last season was not highly educated, but he was a very smart guy.  He was a very cunning guy. MATTHEWS:  Right. TRUMP:  But my natural bias is to go for education.  I‘m a big believer in education. MATTHEWS:  Speaking of executive recruitment, what do you think of the Bernie Kerik situation?  What do you think went wrong there in picking the secretary of homeland security? TRUMP:  Well, Bernie‘s a friend of mine.  He‘s a great guy.  He‘s really a good guy. And it‘s very unfortunate.  The problem is, you‘ll get some white-toast guy in a position like that.  And you need somebody like Bernie that understands the ropes a little bit in order to solve the problem of terrorism.  I‘m not sure that a normal, nicely educated, soft-spoken, wonderful guy is going to necessarily be in there and do the job that you need.  Bernie Kerik is a good guy.  It‘s really a shame and it‘s a shame for the country. MATTHEWS:  Do you think the president should have stuck behind him? TRUMP:  No, I think they did the right thing, and Bernie understood that. Bernie was in charge of the sort of thing that he did the violation on.  But Bernie understood that.  Bernie never put the president in that position and he did a good thing by not doing so. MATTHEWS:  Let‘s talk about the economy.  I want to ask you.  I‘ve only got a couple minutes left here, Donald.  I want to ask you about the three big concerns I have as one of the many Americans worried about the economy. The dollar, are you worried about them letting it go too low in the world market? TRUMP:  Well, the dollar is keeping the economy good in a sense, because people are coming to New York.  As an example, they‘re buying apartments in New York.  They‘re using the hotels.  The dollar—it‘s a horrible word when they say the low dollar, the cheap dollar.  It‘s a terrible word to use.  But the fact is, it happens to bring a lot of business into this country. MATTHEWS:  But it‘s great to travel in this country.  It‘s a terrible situation to travel overseas with, right? TRUMP:  Well, that‘s right, but it keeps people here.  So I‘m not sure that is so bad. MATTHEWS:  You are not worried that there will come a time when the people who are lending us money from the Far East, China and Japan, will simply say I don‘t like the value of the dollar anymore; I‘m getting out?  And then we‘re in big trouble with a bank run basically on U.S. paper. TRUMP:  I don‘t see it happening.  This is one country that it‘s just not going to happen to. Having the dollar where it‘s a reduced value a little bit, it sounds terrible and you hate to say it, but the fact is, it brings business and it is actually good in terms of what we all do. MATTHEWS:  So you expect they will keep this policy? TRUMP:  I think they‘re going to keep the policy.  I think the dollar is probably going to inch up a little bit.  And that is not so bad. But the worst times we‘ve had is when you had a very strong dollar. Nothing came in at all. (CROSSTALK) TRUMP:  And having a strong dollar, it turned out to be—it sounds good.  That one sounds great, but nothing happens good for the country. MATTHEWS:  Well, what about when you compound the situation by a long ·         a big long-term borrowing situation in addition to the couple billion—we‘re borrowing about $600 billion a year now.  What happens when you add to that the big money we‘re going to have to borrow to carry Social Security into this new form of individual accounts?  That big short-term deficits for the federal budget.  Does that take us over the tipping point with regard to the value of the dollar, all that borrowing? TRUMP:  Well, we‘ve had the deficits before, and we‘re going to have them again and we‘re going to have them for a while, and the war is certainly costing a tremendous amount of money, far more than anyone ever thought. The key is as long as interest rates stay low, Chris.  If interest rates are low, we‘re going to be fine.  If interest rates go up and the dollar goes up, that is a really devastating combination. MATTHEWS:  Well, how do you avoid rising interest rates if you double the borrowing with the new Social Security plan? TRUMP:  Well, it is really amazing, because I‘ve been asking that for the last year or so.  And the fact is that rates are still very low.  They continue to be low and I‘m very happy about it, because I can tell you, the real estate industry, the entire—so many different industries, if rates go up, they‘re going to collapse and it‘s not going to be good. So, if we can keep the dollar pretty much where it is, even a little bit higher is fine, and interest rates keep low, we‘re going to be in good shape. MATTHEWS:  You‘re not afraid this isn‘t just another bubble situation, where it doesn‘t go wrong until it does go wrong and then it‘s really bad? TRUMP:  Well, Chris, don‘t forget, at some point, it always goes wrong.  No matter where, no matter when, it always goes wrong.  We‘ve been riding something very good and very strong for a long period of time.  At some point, things will happen and they won‘t be pleasant.  And you know what?  We‘ll get out of them and it will be all right. MATTHEWS:  If you were the president of the United States, would you push individual retirement accounts for Social Security? TRUMP:  I sort of think I would.  Something has to be done.  Social Security is a huge problem right now, funding it.  And something‘s going to have to be done and it‘s going to have to be done very quickly, actually.  I think they‘re moving on different methods.  But something is going to have to be done rather quickly. MATTHEWS:  OK.  It‘s great having you on. TRUMP:  Thank you. MATTHEWS:  Good luck with the show Thursday night.  Good luck with your wedding coming up.  It‘s fabulous.  Everybody is going to want to see that. Anyway, thank you very much, Donald Trump, for coming on HARDBALL. TRUMP:  Thank you, Chris. MATTHEWS:  When we return, who are the leading candidates to be President Bush‘s nominee now for homeland security secretary, now that Bernard Kerik has withdrawn? And on Thursday, a very special edition of HARDBALL.  We‘ve been out there talking to people already on that.  We‘re taking the show to Walter Reed Hospital with a story about a soldier‘s journey home.  I had a chance to talk to one of them earlier.  Here‘s a preview. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEWS:  Do you want to go back over to Afghanistan or Iraq? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  If I had the opportunity I would. MATTHEWS:  Why? UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  It‘s what I want.  It‘s—I‘m not trying to sound brainwashed or anything like that, but... MATTHEWS:  You don‘t. UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  I‘m a soldier.  My place to be is—I am hired to fight wars for this country.  That‘s my place.  That‘s where I should be. (END VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEWS:  Some story, “A Soldier‘s Journey Home,” right here on HARDBALL this Thursday night at our regular time, 7:00 Eastern. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTHEWS:  Coming up, “Newsweek”‘s Michael Isikoff, “The Washington Post”‘s John Mintz, and Russ Buettner of “The New York Daily News” on Bernard Kerik‘s withdrawal as President Bush‘s nominee for homeland security secretary.  More HARDBALL, real HARDBALL, after this. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTHEWS:  Welcome back to HARDBALL. In the wake of Bernard Kerik‘s abrupt withdrawal as nominee-designate for homeland security secretary, “Newsweek” magazine reports that, in 1998, the state of New Jersey issued a warrant for his arrest.  That‘s Bernard Kerik‘s arrest.  “The Washington Post” reported that Kerik was involved in some unsavory investigation work as head of security for a Saudi Arabian hospital back in the 1980s.  And, finally, “The New York Daily News” today reported on connections Kerik had with a firm allegedly tied to the mob. Kerik commented on the matter earlier today. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) BERNARD KERIK, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: I apologize to anybody that‘s been brought into this unnecessarily, particularly the mayor, the president and his administration, Judith Regan and Pinero.  My withdrawal is my fault.  What happened between me and the White House is my fault.  It‘s nobody else‘s and I‘ll deal with it. (END VIDEO CLIP) MATTHEWS:  “Newsweek” magazine‘s Michael Isikoff is an investigation reporter.  John Mintz is a staff write for “The Washington Post.”  And Russ Buettner wrote the cover story in today‘s “New York Daily News.” Let me go, first of all, to Michael Isikoff. The fallout here.  What‘s the damage politically to the president‘s relationship with Rudy Giuliani out of this? MICHAEL ISIKOFF, “NEWSWEEK”:  Well, it‘s clearly a momentary embarrassment for the president, for Giuliani, who pressed the president to nominate Kerik. It‘s also I think raising some serious questions about the White House vetting operation, overseen by the White House Counsel‘s office, headed by Alberto Gonzales, the nominee to be attorney general.  I think there‘s a lot of questions to be raised there. One thing that was clear from the stories over the last week is, there was just a wealth of allegations that swirled around Kerik that were uncovered by reporters since he—immediately after he was nominated, yet somehow a lot of these were just simply not addressed in the vetting process.  So you‘ve got to wonder, where were the vetters?  How tough were the questions asked of Kerik? (CROSSTALK) MATTHEWS:  Let me go to John Mintz on that. Was it possible that Bernard Kerik got a bye in vetting process because of the endorsement he got from Rudy? JOHN MINTZ, “THE WASHINGTON POST”:  I believe that‘s so.  I gather that—I was told by an administration official that Rudy Giuliani called up the president and said, Mr. President, you know that I have not asked you for favors in the past, but I am asking you today to name my friend Bernard Kerik as the head of the Homeland Security Department.  And I‘m told that that played a big role in Kerik being named. MATTHEWS:  Is that why we got word in your paper today.  Well, I don‘t ·         I‘ll say maybe—could I come to believe that‘s the reason we heard in your paper today, or yesterday, actually, very strong condemnations of Bernard Kerik for having been forewarned that, if he lied about domestic servants or not paying taxes on illegal immigrants, that that would be a humiliation on him, on his family and on the president? MINTZ:  It‘s unclear to us exactly what went on in these discussions between White House officials and Kerik, but clearly he had been put on warning by the White House officials, you‘ve got to be straight with us.  This is really important.  When we ask you about nannies and immigration status, since you are to be the one who is overseeing immigration matters for the United States government, you‘ve got to be straight with us. And apparently Kerik came back to them later and said, oops, I just discovered there were some problems with this nanny, but she‘s left anyway. MATTHEWS:  Yes.  She left—it‘s like she hid her out of the country. Let me ask you again, John, this question of a conflict between the vetting operation, which I assume has been pretty good before, and this contest to try to win the heart of Rudy Giuliani.  Do you think they went into conflict with each other to the point where the president has to broker this thing in the end and say, wait a minute; I‘ve heard all the bad stuff about Kerik, but Rudy wants him and I‘m going to go with him? MINTZ:  I‘m not clear on whether the White House or the president had heard anything bad about Kerik before he was named.  I think that the president probably was not informed about this controversial stuff. These controversial matters, as Mike Isikoff said, they‘re like low-hanging fruit. MATTHEWS:  Right. MINTZ:  You just have to go call people in New York and New Jersey and you‘ll find out. MATTHEWS:  Well, let‘s give Russ a little more credit than going for the low-hanging fruit. Russ, when you reported this story today, it seemed like you got a lot of—it was whole pile of stuff you got on this guy today.  Why do you think you guys could get it and the White House couldn‘t? RUSS BUETTNER, “NEW YORK DAILY NEWS”:  Well, it didn‘t come to us overnight. Our interest in this story began two years ago when we started uncovering a corruption scandal within the correction department that really had its roots in Mr. Kerik‘s time there.  And this is actually an extension of that.  I‘ve been working on these stories for six months, looking into... (CROSSTALK) MATTHEWS:  When did begin to print—send them to publication? BUETTNER:  We notified Mr. Kerik around noon on December 2, the day before he was nominated, that we were about to publish this round of stories. MATTHEWS:  What is the relationship as you know it between Rudy Giuliani and Bernard Kerik?  Why does Rudy have such devotion to this man‘s career? BUETTNER:  The Giuliani administration, above all else, valued loyalty.  That was the mantra that you heard over and over again.  And Bernie was absolutely the most loyal lieutenant that Rudy had within the administration.  And most people believe that‘s the reason that he has stayed closest to Mr. Giuliani since he has left office. MATTHEWS:  Did Giuliani know about that mob problem with Kerik? MINTZ:  That‘s not clear.  It‘s very difficult to tell what was said and what wasn‘t said.  Mr. Kerik‘s had a lot of interesting interactions in his outside life, and some of that has overlapped into his professional life, but it‘s not clear the nature of the exchange between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Kerik. MATTHEWS:  Well, wouldn‘t this warrant for his arrest in New Jersey have been picked up on any kind of full-field FBI check?  And did Rudy never run a check on his own man? BUETTNER:  That‘s a very good question.  And there‘s a lot of people who are wondering just those kinds of things.  And some people have the perception that‘s what the loyalty was all about, that, if you were loyal, other things were ignored and you were helped along, regardless of what there might be. (CROSSTALK) MATTHEWS:  Michael Isikoff, you can run a check on somebody and ask them if they‘ve ever been arrested or ever been under suspicion in almost any category of law problems.  Why didn‘t Rudy know about this, about Bernard Kerik, before he pushed him so hard? ISIKOFF:  No, I don‘t know. And my colleague Mark Hosenball uncovered that arrest warrant sitting at his computer working for a few minutes.  But one question on the loyalty issue.  It‘s certainly true that Kerik and Rudy Giuliani worked together when Rudy was mayor and Kerik was the police commissioner and that they‘re close personal friends.  But it‘s also worth remembering that they‘re also business partners, have been business partners for the last few years.  And that—you know, that‘s a factor in considering why Giuliani pushed so hard to get Kerik the job. MATTHEWS:  You mean having him on the inside might have meant some contracts flowing in his direction? ISIKOFF:  Well, we certainly do know enough about Giuliani & Associates to know that they make their business in the security world and offering security assessments and security advice to governments and private contractors. So I‘m sure, if you‘re in that line of work, having your business partner as the secretary of homeland security is not unhelpful. MATTHEWS:  OK, Michael and everybody and Russ and John, hold on for a second.  We‘re going to right back for a short break—after a short break. Coming up, more on the political fallout of Bernard Kerik‘s withdrawal when we return. And don‘t forget to check out Hardblogger, our political blog Web site.  Just go to HARDBALL.MSNBC.com. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) MATTHEWS:  We‘re back for more with “Newsweek”‘s Michael Isikoff, “The Washington Post”‘s John Mintz and Russ Buettner of “The New York Daily News.” Russ, you gave us kind of an interesting little tidbit right before we went to break.  You said that you called up Bernard Kerik before he was announced for secretary of homeland security with your concerns, the stories you were reporting at the time.  What was his reaction? BUETTNER:  Actually, I never got a call back, Chris.  I left a long voice-mail about the categories of things we were looking into with his office, and I never received a call back.  There were some people who were attached to him who tried to lobby our newspaper to keep us from publishing that story, but I never heard back. MATTHEWS:  Who were those people? BUETTNER:  I can‘t say. MATTHEWS:  Why not? (LAUGHTER) BUETTNER:  Some of those conversations are held in confidence and it‘s not... MATTHEWS:  Well, how about the ones that are not held in confidence? (LAUGHTER) MATTHEWS:  Who were the people that called up and told you kill the story, to spike it? (LAUGHTER) BUETTNER:  I wasn‘t privy to those conversations. MATTHEWS:  Was there any muscle involved, any threats? (LAUGHTER) BUETTNER:  Not that I‘m aware of, no. MATTHEWS:  OK.  Not that I‘m aware of?  You sound like Alger Hiss. Let me ask you, Michael Isikoff, in your dealings with Bernard Kerik, did you get any—any feedback from him, or did he stonewall you? ISIKOFF:  We talked to his people.  We didn‘t talk directly to him. I don‘t think he was—my understanding is he wasn‘t talking directly to reporters.  That‘s generally the case when somebody gets nominated for a position.  They‘re kept away from the press. MATTHEWS:  So you didn‘t get any... John Mintz, your experience in reporting this story? MINTZ:  I was unable to reach Bernard Kerik for the reasons Mike Isikoff just mentioned.  Instead, his advocates to me in the story I did about his experience in Saudi Arabia, it was people in the Bush administration who called back and pleaded his case. MATTHEWS:  Did anybody call you and try to spike your story, try to warn you off? MINTZ:  They tried to warn me off and say that it was a bunch of bunkum, but they didn‘t offer any threats at all.  It wasn‘t like that. MATTHEWS:  Bunkum?  Was it Charles Dickens that called you? (LAUGHTER) MATTHEWS:  Where did they get that word from? Anyway, let me ask you—start with you, John—in all seriousness, what do you—as the Washington guy here, along with Michael, what do you think is the impact here between the president and Rudy Giuliani?  Because he was Giuliani‘s candidate. MINTZ:  Well, I think that Rudy Giuliani is going to be very embarrassed in his dealings with the White House and with President Bush.  He pressed a guy onto President Bush and onto the nation onto, a guy who it turned out after just a few days, his nomination crumpled. And I‘m not sure how truly close these two men are, but they clearly do have an alliance and a kind of friendship.  And we‘ll just have to see if Rudy Giuliani is still welcome at this White House. MATTHEWS:  I guess one careful bet we could make here is that Bernard Kerik will not be his proposed running mate if he runs for president. MINTZ:  I think we can bet on that, yes, Chris. MATTHEWS:  Let me ask Michael Isikoff. You‘re good at this intrigue.  What is this going to say to the White House?  Are they going to start putting down Rudy Giuliani now?  Is this their opportunity, their permission slip to remove him as a potential presidential candidate? ISIKOFF:  Oh, we‘re like at least three or so years away from that, but I think what he will really say to the White House—Kerik was a deviation from the norm in one way.  He was a colorful, independent guy. And I‘ve got to say, at least some of us in the press are a little sorry he didn‘t go further. MATTHEWS:  Right. ISIKOFF:  Because he would have been great copy. But what I fear is what we‘re going to get is somebody just in the mold of the rest of the Cabinet nominees, on message, bland, simply echoing the White House line. MATTHEWS:  Somebody else, Michael, from the White House secretarial pool. ISIKOFF:  Yes. MATTHEWS:  For the next Cabinet post. Anyway, thank you very much, Michael Isikoff, Russ Buettner, and John Mintz. Join us again tomorrow at 7:00 Eastern for more HARDBALL.  And on Thursday, don‘t forget our special from Walter Reed Hospital, “A Soldier‘s Journey Home.” Right now, it‘s time for the “COUNTDOWN” with Keith.

But that doesn’t confirm that the amount of fentanyl flowing into the U.S. has been cut in half. Fentanyl seizure data tells us only how much fentanyl was stopped from entering the U.S., not how much entered. One drug policy expert said a rise in seizures generally signals that more fentanyl is entering the U.S. Another expert said the data could be interpreted either way: as more coming in, or as less coming in.",

                "text_body": "Advertisement Supported by A rule finalized on Friday by the Department of Health and Human Services means that the federal government no longer recognizes gender identity as an avenue for sex discrimination in health care. ByMargot Sanger-KatzandNoah Weiland WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Friday finalizeda regulationthat will erase protections fortransgender patientsagainst discrimination by doctors, hospitals andhealth insurance companies, a move announced on thefour-year anniversaryof the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando and in the middle of Pride Month. The rule, which does not differ much from a proposed versionreleased last year, is part of a broad Trump administration effort across multiple areas of policy — includingeducation,housing, andemployment, as well ashealth care— to narrow the legal definition of sex discrimination so that it does not include protections for transgender people. The Affordable Care Act, the 2010 law often known as Obamacare, established broad civil rights protections in health care, barring discrimination based on race, color, national origin, sex, age or disability in “any health program or activity” that receives federal financial assistance. The Obama administration interpreted the provision about sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of “gender identity.” Under the original 2016 rule, health care providers and insurerswould have been requiredto provide and cover medically appropriate treatment fortransgender patients. Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, the unit responsible for the rule, said in an interview Friday that the move was “equivalent to housekeeping,” and that the federal government was “updating our books to reflect the legal reality” that sex discrimination language does not explicitly refer to the legal status of transgender people. The Obama rule has been tied up in litigation for several years, and the Trump administration has declined to enforce it, citing a court ruling from a judge in Fort Worth. That means that the final rule does not have any immediate practical effects. Other courts that considered identical legal questions found in favor of the Obama administration’s interpretation. Mr. Severino, who attained prominence as a social conservative before joining the Trump administration, said that health providers were still free to adopt their own gender identity policies, as were health insurers. “It’s not the role of the federal bureaucrat to impose their own meanings on the words that their representatives have enshrined into law,” he said. Mr. Severino defended the timing of the rule’s release during Pride Month and on the Pulse massacre anniversary, saying it was “purely coincidental.” Transgender rights advocates criticized the timing for another reason: the coronavirus. “It’s really, really horrendous to not only gut nondiscrimination protections, but to gut nondiscrimination protections in the middle of a pandemic,” said Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality. “This rule opens a door for a medical provider to turn someone away for a Covid-19 test just because they happen to be transgender.” The announcement also prompted an outcry from the Human Rights Campaign, a prominent lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer advocacy group, which said it plans to sue the Trump administration. “We will not let this attack on our basic right to be free from discrimination in health care go unchallenged. We will see them in court, and continue to challenge all of our elected officials to rise up against this blatant attempt to erode critical protections people need and sanction discrimination,” the organization said in a statement. Mr. Severino, who spent seven years in civil-rights enforcement at the Justice Department and once oversaw the DeVos Center for Religion and Civil Society at the Heritage Foundation, said that the Trump administration would defend the decision in court. Mr. Severino hasextensive experiencelitigating religious liberty cases. His current office is responsible for investigating discriminatory violations in health care. Katie M. Keith, who teaches health law at Georgetown University and has closely tracked this area of civil rights law, said the rule finalized Friday needed to be seen as part of a broad pattern of regulatory changes that eliminate civil rights protections for transgender people and establishes a definition of sex as being biologically determined at birth. That idea “is what they are pushing forward on all of these different policy angles across different agencies,” she said. Rolling back the health care rule has been a cause for social conservatives since its implementation, including Mr. Severino, whocriticized itwhile at the Heritage Foundation. They have accused the Obama administration ofcoercing doctorsinto sexual reassignment operations, procedures that are typically handled by specialists. Another rule issued by Mr. Severino’s office last year wouldprovide additional “conscience” protectionsfor health care workers with religious or moral objections to certain types of care. That rule has beenvoidedby several federal courts. The rule also reverses other provisions of the original Obama-administration interpretation of the statute. It eliminates anti-discrimination protections for patients with a history of pregnancy termination. And it rolls back requirements that providers and insurers must routinely notify patients about the availability of foreign language translations of important documents.

ByAlisha Haridasani Gupta — Tanya Asapansa-Johnson Walker, one of two transgender women who are suing the Trump administration In Her Words is available as a newsletter.Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox. About two months ago, the U.S. Supreme Court determined in a landmark ruling that protections in the Civil Rights Act against discrimination in the workplace “on the basis of sex” extend togay and transgender people, too. But just three days before that ruling, amid a raging pandemic, the Department of Health and Human Services erased provisions in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, about sex discrimination that included gender identity anddefined sex as the biological male-female binary assigned at birth. In other words, as the Supreme Court essentially broadened the definition of sex, the Trump administration had narrowed it. That the two contradictory developments came so close to each other was most likely not a coincidence: The Department of Health and Human Services acknowledged in its published rules that the Supreme Court would soon make an important ruling in a pair of cases (Bostock v. Clayton County, Ga. and R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) that could have an impact on its actions. But the agency went on to say that it “need not delay a rule based on speculation as to what the Supreme Court might say.” “The timing might even suggest to a cynic that the agency pushed ahead specifically to avoid having to address an adverse decision,”noted one federal judge, Frederic Block. Days after the Supreme Court decision, the health department formally published its modified rules, which raised the question: Is the Trump administration’s decision to erase Obama-era protections for gay andtransgender patientsnow illegal? That question is at the heart of a lawsuit brought by two transgender women in New York — Tanya Asapansa-Johnson Walker, 57, and Cecilia Gentili, 48 — against the Department of Health and Human Services. “The government failed to take into account the implications of the Supreme Court decision,” said Jason Starr, director of litigation at the Human Rights Campaign, a nonprofit that is representing both Ms. Walker and Ms. Gentili. “That makes this rule unlawful.” In addition to interviews with The Times, the more than 30 pages of personal statements submitted byMs. GentiliandMs. Walkeras part of the lawsuit paint a harrowing picture of the systemic discrimination trans people face when trying to accesshealth care. Both women are prominent activists in the L.G.B.T.Q. community. Ms. Walker, an Army veteran, is the co-founder of the New York Transgender Advocacy Group, or NYTAG, and Ms. Gentili, is a consultant helping businesses withtransgendersensitivity and inclusion issues. She has also appeared in a few episodes of the award-winning TV series “Pose.” Over their lifetimes, they have had consistently negative experiences at the hands of medical professionals. Both have been told that their gender identity was a psychological condition that could be treated (Ms. Walker was even given medication for schizophrenia), both have been misgendered, both have been called by the names assigned to them at birth rather than the ones they have chosen, and they have endured being mocked and denied care — all of which, they said, had made them wary of seeking health care. “Trans people, because of all of our past experiences, do not go and access medical services when we need it,” Ms. Gentili explained in the interview. The dangers of that are amplified during a pandemic, she added. “Mybest friend, who is also trans, just died of Covid-19. She was sick for more than a week, and she chose not to go and see a doctor.” Once, in 2001, Ms. Gentili was suffering from intense stomach pains and went to see a doctor. The doctor started touching around her stomach as part of the checkup and asked her to slightly pull down her clothes, she recalled. “When I did that, part of my genitalia became visible,” Ms. Gentili said. “The doctor jumped back and told me he couldn’t see me and sent me back home with no treatment at all. Imagine if it was something life-threatening?” A2015 survey by the National Center for Transgender Equalityof over 27,000 trans people found that more than a third of respondents who saw a health provider in the previous year reported having a negative experience, including verbal harassment or refusal of treatment, and more than half of the respondents who sought insurance coverage for transition-related surgeries in the previous year were denied. In July 2016, the Obama administrationissued a new ruleclarifying that Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act prohibited discrimination on the basis of sex, and that included discrimination based on gender identity (“an individual’s internal sense of gender, which may be different from that individual’s sex assigned at birth”). The rule made it illegal for health insurance providers to categorize gender transition-related treatments as cosmetic and to explicitly exclude those treatments from their plans. It also set up mechanisms for patients to file discrimination complaints with the H.H.S.’s Office for Civil Rights and established the so-called private right to action, which allowed consumers to file lawsuits in federal courts related to reported violations of Section 1557. In 2017, Ms. Walker was diagnosed with lung cancer, her second such diagnosis. When she went to the hospital for treatment, she was consistently misgendered, with one nurse saying, “However you look and whoever you say you are out there, in here I am going to call you as I see you,” Ms. Walker writes in her personal statement. After undergoing an intensive surgery to remove a part of her lung, she said she received inadequate care at the hospital, with nurses ignoring her requests and, at one point, leaving her to lie amid her own feces for hours — mistreatment that she says in her statement was because of her transgender identity. “I’m an honorably discharged veteran and to go to the hospital and be mistreated — it’s violence,” Ms. Walker said in the interview. She filed a complaint with the hospital but said she never heard back. That same year, Ms. Gentili was also denied coverage by her insurer to replace her breast implants because the surgery was deemed cosmetic (the Food and Drug Administration states that implants are not “lifetime devices” and recommends replacing them to avoid health complications). “My breasts are not cosmetic for me,” Ms. Gentili said. “They are part of my identity. At this point in my life, I just don’t see myself without them.” In the end, Ms. Gentili said she paid for the surgery out of pocket. Aetna, Ms. Gentili’s insurance provider at the time, confirmed that in 2017 a breast replacement would have been deemed cosmetic. In August this year, thecompany changed its policyto cover “breast augmentation for transfeminine members.” That these experiences of discrimination persisted after the Obamacare protections isn’t necessarily proof that they were ineffectual, said Sharita Gruberg, senior director for the L.G.B.T.Q. research project at the Center for American Progress. “The Civil Rights Act didn’t eliminate race discrimination,” she explained, “it signaled that this is something that our country sees as antithetical to who we are and gave people a mechanism to ensure the government upholds their rights. That’s what Section 1557 was, too.” In herown research in 2018, Ms. Gruberg analyzed complaints filed to the H.H.S. of discrimination based on sexual orientation, on sex stereotyping related to sexual orientation and those based on gender identity, from 2010 to 2017. “What we found is that the impact of each of these complaints and investigations was so much bigger than the individual case,” Ms. Gruberg said. “In a lot of cases, the H.H.S. worked with the entity that the complaint was filed against to remedy how care is provided beyond just that complaint, so enacting training for staff, changing policies and really identifying how they can improve care,” she said. In August 2016, a month after the Obama administration issued its interpretation of Section 1557, a hospital system, Franciscan Alliance, and five states came together to challenge the rule’s definition of sex, claiming it was too broad and violated the religious freedoms of medical professionals. That case was filed in the Northern District of Texas, and was one of several similar cases filed around the country. The judge presiding over the case in Texas, Reed O’Connor, in December 2016 issued a nationwidetemporary injunction, blocking the portion of the Obamacare rule that prohibited discrimination on the basis of gender identity from taking effect. Then President Trump was inaugurated. The new administration, instead of appealing Judge O’Connor’s decision, left it standing, signaling that it would come up with its own set of rules soon. It took the Trump administration more than three years to proposea clarification: Sex “refers to the biological binary of male and female.” This new rule, known as the 2020 Rule, “eliminates the 2016 Rule’s definitions” of sex, the health department stated. Additionally, the department stated it “no longer intends to take a position on” the private right to action. That latter part, experts say, is significant. In practice, it means that while individuals can still file a claim in court saying their rights have been violated, a court may say that the regulations do not permit such suits. “Those protections are not laid out in the regulations anymore,” leaving it to individual courts to decide, said Lindsey Dawson, associate director of H.I.V. policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation who also focuses on L.G.B.T.Q. health policy issues. Plus, “litigation is expensive,” Ms. Gruberg said. “That’s why having these really clear and explicit protections was so important because it allowed people to file a complaint for free and have H.H.S. investigate that complaint,” she added. The H.H.S. in its 2020 Rule claimed that expanding the definition of sex in 2016 was executive overreach and that it placed unnecessary and expensive “regulatory burdens” on health practices and insurers — some of the same rationales provided forthe administration’s ongoing effort to roll back protections for trans peoplein the military, schools, prisons and homeless shelters and for those working in federal jobs. The 2016 Rule also “imposed confusing or contradictory demands on providers, interfered inappropriately with their medical judgment, and potentially burdened their consciences,” the H.H.S. argued. But in a turn of events that the Trump administration most likely wasn’t expecting, the largely conservative Supreme Court embraced a broader definition of sex than the one the White House was relying on. “It is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex,” Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, President Trump’s appointment, wrote for the majority. A few days after that ruling, Ms. Gentili and Ms. Walker filed their case in the Eastern District of New York — one of a handful across the country — represented bythe Human Rights Campaign and the law firm BakerHostetler. They argue that the H.H.S.’s new rule “directly contravenes” the new Supreme Court ruling and, if put in effect, would leave trans people once again vulnerable to discrimination. “Health care professionals and staff have discriminated against plaintiffs prior to and after the 2016 Rule,” their case filing states. “Plaintiffs fear that the 2020 Rule will only increase the likelihood that they will experience this discrimination again.” A federal judge has since temporarily blocked the Trump administration’s new health regulations from going into effect. “When the Supreme Court announces a major decision, it seems a sensible thing to pause and reflect on the decision’s impact,”said Judge Blockwhen issuing the temporary injunction on August 17. The Trump administration has now requested a standard extension to either respond to the allegations or dismiss the case, and the government’s response would be due on Oct. 2. But if the government decides to push ahead, its case now seems thin in light of the Supreme Court ruling, said Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan with a focus on health care law. “The bottom line is that Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act now means that you can’t discriminate against transgender people,” he said.

Roger Severino, head of the HHS civil rights office, disputed that new rules on LGBTQ patients would endanger patients during the pandemic. | Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images ByDan Diamond 06/12/2020 04:51 PM EDT Updated:06/12/2020 06:43 PM EDT Link Copied The Trump administration on Friday formallyrolled back an Obama-era policythat protected LGBTQ patients from discrimination and required robust language translation services, unnerving health experts who worry vulnerable populations will face further risks during the Covid-19 pandemic. The move —long sought by some of President Donald Trump’s supportersin the conservative Christian community — is the latest effort by Trump to mobilize his religious base amid criticism over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak and the recent protests over the death of George Floyd in police custody. The new Trump administration rules reverse an Obama policy that banned health care providers from discriminating against transgender patients and women seeking abortions. The Obama administration had issued the first-time protections for LGBTQ patients under a nondiscrimination clause in the Affordable Care Act, citing concerns from advocates these patients had a harder time accessing necessary care, The Trump administration overhaul, which had been years in the making, came against warnings from health care groups that the rollback could make it easier for hospitals and health care workers to discriminate against patients based on their gender or sexual orientation. It also was panned by advocates who noted that the rule was released on the four-year anniversary of the mass shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, where 49 people were killed and dozens more injured. “These actions demonstrate how little this Administration values the life, health and safety of LGBTQ people,” said Sharita Gruberg of the Center for American Progress. “It’s even more of a disgrace to do so on the anniversary of the deadliest attack on the LGBTQ community in US history.” Roger Severino, head of the HHS civil rights office, said the timing of the rule’s release is “purely coincidental.” He also disputed that the new rules would endanger patients during the pandemic. “Especially during the Covid-19 pandemic, we’ve gone into overdrive in terms of our civil rights enforcement, and that will not be affected,” he said, citing recent efforts to enforce disability rights protections and other civil rights. “Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and accordance with the law.” POLITICO first reported in late April thatthe Trump administration was finalizing the rulesat a time when the U.S. was recording nearly 30,000 coronavirus infections each day. Trump health officials have rejected accusations they’re eliminating patient protections, given that a federal judge in Texas threw out a portion of the Obama-era rules last year, following a lawsuit from religious groups. Under the Obama administration’s interpretation of sex discrimination, HHS in May 2016 banned health providers fromdiscriminating against patients based on their gender identity or whether they had sought an abortion. However, those rules had never taken effect because they were frozen by the same judge since late 2016, shortly after they were issued. The new rules “will eliminate mass confusion that was unleashed by the Obama-era decision to redefine sex to cover a wide array of gender identities,” said Severino, who created a division within his office focused on religious freedom protections. The new Trump rules also roll backObama-era requirements that the vast majority of health care providers post informationin 15 languages and make translation services readily available. The reversal has alarmed advocates for communities of color, given how the coronavirus isdisproportionately affecting minority populations, including some who may not be fluent in English. Advocates on Friday also warned that many patients need language help to navigate the U.S. health system, noting that one-third of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United Stateshave limited English proficiency. But Severino argued that those postings had created burdens for health care providers and were often unnecessary. He said the rule would save the health care industry about $3 billion over five years, mostly from striking multilingual notices. The new rules land as Trump made concentrated efforts to shore up support from his religious base in an election year.Trump has repeatedly pushed for churches to swiftly reopenduring the pandemic, despite concerns public health experts have raised about the risks of virus spread in houses of worship. Trump earlier this month drew sharp rebuke from some faith leaders over the violent dispersal of peaceful protesters at the White House to accommodate his brief photo-op outside a nearby church. President Donald Trump and Melania Trumphave tested positivefor Covid-19. Religious and conservative groups like the Catholic Association, the Heritage Foundation and the Family Research Council applauded the Trump administration for rolling back the protections for transgender patients and women seeking abortions. The groups claimed that the Obama-era rules would have forced health workers to perform procedures against their conscience or religious beliefs. “President Trump is the most pro-life president our nation has ever seen, and today he delivered another important victory for conscience in America,” Marjorie Dannenfelser of the anti-abortion Susan B. Anthony List said in a statement. “Abortion is not health care and should never be mandated by the government.” But senior Democrats seized on the new rules as Trump’s latest effort to weaken Obamacare and curtail patient protections. Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), whodecried the rules, is exploring options for a legislative response, a spokesperson said. “We will fight to overturn this harmful rule because we cannot allow President Trump to send us back to a time of blatant health care discrimination against patients,” the chairs of four House committees vowed in a joint statement.  © 2024 POLITICO LLC"

                "text_body": "A federal judge on Monday blocked theTrump administration’s rollback of an Obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health careagainst patients who are transgender, a day before it was set to go into effect. US District Court Judge Frederic Block found that the planned rollback,which was announced in June,violatesthe Supreme Court’s landmark rulingthat extended federal civil rights law to gay, lesbian and transgender workers. “In this case, the Court is tasked with having to decide if a proposed set of rules by the Department of Health and Human Services … is contrary to the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in Bostock or if the agency acted arbitrarily or capriciously in enacting the rules,” Blockwrote in the preliminary injunction. “(The) Court concludes that the proposed rules are, indeed, contrary to Bostock and, in addition, that HHS did act arbitrarily and capriciously in enacting them. Therefore, it grants plaintiffs’ application for a stay and preliminary injunction to preclude the rules from becoming operative.” An HHS spokesperson said in a statement that the department is “disappointed in the court’s decision.” CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for comment. The department was planning to nix some provisions of a 2016 rule that interpreted the Affordable Care Act’s ban on sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity, saying it would enforce the ban “according to the plain meaning of the word ‘sex’ as male or female and as determined by biology.” A number of LGBTQ groups had strongly criticized HHS’ plan,saying it would allow health care providers to openly discriminate against transgender patients. Monday’s decision came in response to a case brought in June by the Human Rights Campaign, which represented two transgender women of color who “experienced discrimination based on their transgender status,” according to the ruling. The group’s president, Alphonso David, called the ruling a “crucial early victory” for the plaintiffs. “We are pleased the Court recognized this irrational rule for what it is: discrimination, plain and simple. LGBTQ Americans deserve the health care that they need without fear of mistreatment, harassment, or humiliation,” he said in a statement. Block leaned heavily on the Supreme Court’s June ruling, which related to discrimination in the workplace and extended protection for LGBTQ workers but opened the door to other challenges to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or transgender status. The department published the rule change in the Federal Register four days after the justices passed down the historic ruling. “Had the agency correctly predicted the outcome in Bostock, it may well have taken a different path. Instead, it continued on the same path even after Bostock was decided. This satisfies the Court that the premise of the repeal was a disagreement with a concept of sex discrimination later embraced by the Supreme Court. Therefore, the repeal was contrary to law,” he wrote. “The Court reiterates the same practical concern it raised at oral argument: When the Supreme Court announces a major decision, it seems a sensible thing to pause and reflect on the decision’s impact,” the ruling read. “Since HHS has been unwilling to take that path voluntarily, the Court now imposes it.” Lambda Legal, another LGBTQ group thatsued this summer to block the rollback, also welcomed the court’s decision on Monday. “LGBTQ people, particularly transgender people, have been under constant attack by the Trump administration,” said Carl Charles, an attorney with the group. “We applaud today’s decision and look forward to continuing our fight against this rule that unlawfully targets and singles out LGBTQ people for discrimination during their most critical time of need, when seeking health care. Our communities deserve better.” The state of Washington had also sued in July to block the rollback,arguing in its suit that it violates patients’ constitutional rights and the purpose of the ACA to increase access to health care and insurance, by “allowing broad discrimination to interfere with important medical care.” CNN’s Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report. © 2024 Cable News Network.

FILE - In this Friday, June 26, 2015 file photo, people gather in Lafayette Park to see the White House illuminated with rainbow colors in commemoration of the Supreme Court’s ruling to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington. The Trump administration Friday, June 12, 2020, finalized a regulation that overturns Obama-era protections for transgender people against sex discrimination in health care. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File) Washington (AP) — In a move applauded by President Donald Trump’s conservative religious base, his administration on Friday finalized a rule that overturns Obama-era protections for transgender people against sex discrimination in health care. The Department of Health and Human Services said it will enforce sex discrimination protections “according to the plain meaning of the word ‘sex’ as male or female and as determined by biology.” This rewrites an Obama-era regulation that sought a broader understanding shaped by a person’s internal sense of being male, female, neither or a combination. LGBTQ groups say explicit protections are needed for people seeking sex-reassignment treatment, and even for transgender people who need care for common illnesses such as diabetes or heart problems. But conservatives say the Obama administration exceeded its legal authority in broadly interpreting gender. The reversal comes in the middle of LGBTQ Pride Month. Activists and Democratic lawmakers noted that Friday was also the four-year anniversary of the mass shooting at the Pulse gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in which 49 people were killed. Behind the dispute over legal rights is a medically recognized condition called “gender dysphoria” — discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between the gender that a person identifies as and the gender at birth. Consequences can include severe depression. Treatment can range from sex-reassignment surgery and hormones to people changing their outward appearance by adopting a different hairstyle or clothing.  Many social conservatives disagree with the concept. “Under the old Obama rule, medical professionals could have been forced to facilitate gender reassignment surgeries and abortions — even if they believed this was a violation of their conscience or believed it harmful to the patient,” said Mary Beth Waddell of the religious conservative Family Research Council. But House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, “Religious freedom is no justification for hatred or bigotry, and every American has the right to seek and receive care without intimidation or fear.” The American Medical Association strongly criticized the Trump administration’s action. “The federal government should never make it more difficult for individuals to access health care — during a pandemic or any other time,” said Dr. Susan Bailey, the group’s president. Under the Obama-era rule, a hospital could be required to perform gender-transition procedures such as hysterectomies if the facility provided that kind of treatment for other medical conditions. The rule was meant to carry out the anti-discrimination section of the Affordable Care Act, which bars sex discrimination in health care but does not use the term “gender identity.” Women’s groups say the new regulations also undermine access to abortion, which is a legal medical procedure. “No one should fear being turned away by a medical provider because of who they are or the personal health decisions they have made,” said Fatima Goss Graves, president of the National Women’s Law Center. The ACLU says it has already moved to try to prevent the rollback of protections for transgender people. The LGBTQ civil rights group Lambda Legal said it will sue. More than 1.5 million Americans identify as transgender, according to the Williams Institute, a think tank focusing on LGBT policy at the UCLA School of Law. A bigger number — 4.5% of the population— identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to Gallup. Roger Severino, head of the HHS unit that enforces civil rights laws, said transgender people continue to be protected by other statutes that bar discrimination in health care on account of race, color, national origin, age, disability and other factors. “Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and according to the law,” said Severino. “Our dedication to our civil rights laws is as strong as ever.” He cited recent actions to safeguard access to treatment for disabled people in the coronavirus pandemic. For the Trump administration it’s the latest in a series of steps to revoke newly won protections for LGBTQ people in areas ranging from the military to housing and education. The administration also has moved to restrict military service by transgender men and women, proposed allowing certain homeless shelters to take gender identity into account in offering someone a bed for the night, and concluded in a 2017 Justice Department memo that federal civil rights law does not protect transgender people from discrimination at work. The new rule would also affect the notices that millions of patients get in multiple languages about their rights to translation services. Such notices often come with insurer “explanation of benefits” forms. The Trump administration says the notice requirement has become a needless burden on health care providers, requiring billions of paper notices to be mailed annually at an estimated five-year cost of $2.9 billion.

FILE - In this Jan. 9, 2019 file photo, construction crews install new border wall sections seen from Tijuana, Mexico. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., says the Pentagon is planning to tap $1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pensions accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long-sought border wall. Durbin told The Associated Press, “it’s coming out of military pay and pensions, $1 billion, that’s the plan.”(AP Photo/Gregory Bull, File) WASHINGTON (AP) — The Pentagon is planning to tap $1 billion in leftover funds from military pay and pension accounts to help President Donald Trump pay for his long-sought border wall, a top Senate Democrat said Thursday. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., told The Associated Press, “It’s coming out of military pay and pensions. $1 billion. That’s the plan.” Durbin said the funds are available because Army recruitment is down and a voluntary early military retirement program is being underutilized. The development comes as Pentagon officials are seeking to minimize the amount of wall money that would come from military construction projects that are so cherished by lawmakers. Durbin said, “Imagine the Democrats making that proposal — that for whatever our project is, we’re going to cut military pay and pensions.” Durbin, the top Democrat on the Appropriations panel for the Pentagon, was among a bipartisan group of lawmakers who met with Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan on Thursday morning. The Pentagon is planning to transfer money from various accounts into a fund dedicated to drug interdiction, with the money then slated to be redirected for border barriers and other purposes. More attention has been paid to Trump’s declaration of a national emergency to tap up to $3.6 billion from military construction projects to pay for the wall. The Democratic-controlled House voted last month to reject Trump’s move, and the GOP-held Senate is likely to follow suit next week despite a White House lobbying push.  Senate Republicans met again Wednesday to sort through their options in hopes of making next week’s voting more politically palatable. They are struggling to come up with an alternative to simply voting up or down on the House measure as required under a never-used Senate procedure to reject a presidential emergency declaration. Lawmakers in both parties believe Trump is inappropriately infringing on Congress’ power of the purse. Senators are increasingly uneasy ahead of voting next week because they don’t know exactly where the money to build the wall will come from and if it will postpone military projects in their home states. Vice President Mike Pence told senators during their meeting a week ago that he would get back to them with an update. But senators said they don’t yet have a response from the administration. “It’s a concern,” said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. He said a number of senators have been talking to the White House about other ways the administration could shuffle the money without relying on the authority under the emergency declaration, which is likely to become tied up in litigation. The pitch is, “Why have this additional controversy when it could be done in a less controversial way?” he said. “Apparently, the White House is not persuaded.” The Army missed its recruiting goal this year, falling short by about 6,500 soldiers, despite pouring an extra $200 million into bonuses and approving some additional waivers for bad conduct or health issues. Congress also appropriated money to give members of the military incentive to take early retirement, but enrollment in the program is coming in well under expectations. “This is pay that would have gone to Army recruits that we can’t recruit,” Durbin said. “So there’s a ‘savings’ because we can’t recruit. The other part was they offered a voluntary change in military pensions, and they overestimated how many people would sign up for it.” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

                "text_body": "2020 Democratic presidential candidateKamala Harrisnow says she believes that cases of fatal police shootings and alleged police brutality should be handled by an independent investigator – a change in her stance on the issue. “I believe the best approach is to have independent investigations. There is no question,” Harris, a former career prosecutor, said in an interview onMSNBCMonday. Harris previously held the view that local elected officials should continue investigating potential criminal cases against police officers. “I don’t think it would be good public policy to take the discretion from elected district attorneys,” Harris, then California’s attorney general, told theSan Francisco Chroniclein 2014. “I don’t think there’s an inherent conflict. … Where there are abuses, we have designed the system to address them.” Related articleHarris unveils plan to fine companies that don't achieve pay equity Harris told MSNBC on Monday that it was a “personal experience” during her time as district attorney of San Francisco that had informed her prior thinking that cases shouldn’t be taken from locally elected prosecutors. As the city’s top prosecutor, Harris had refused to seek the death penalty in 2004 for the killer ofSan Francisco police officer Isaac Espinoza. “There were people who didn’t agree with my decision and wanted to take the case from me,” Harris recalled. “And so, I had a very real, personal experience where I had to fight to keep my case — and my argument was that, ‘I was elected to exercise my discretion, and no one’s going to take my case from me.’” But Harris said incidents of police shootings and alleged police brutality are a “different issue.” “There’s got to be an independent investigation conducted from the first moments of the incident, so that we can be certain and sure that there has been a thorough investigation that is not informed by bias and so that there will be justice for all of the people concerned,” Harris said. During aCNN town hall in January, Harris was asked by moderator Jake Tapper why, as California attorney general, she had opposed legislation in 2015 that would have required her office to investigate fatal shootings involving police officers. Harris said she did not weigh in on the bill at the time, or any other legislation or initiatives, because she felt it was a conflict of interest with her job as the state’s top law enforcement official. The Washington Postalso found that Harris had taken a stance on a range of pending bills and at least one proposed ballot initiative. Harris’ spokeswoman told the Post the senator had misheard Tapper’s question and misspoke in response. Since announcing her presidential bid, Harris faced increased scrutiny over her criminal justice record andcriticism pushing backon her assertion that she was a “progressive prosecutor,” reforming the criminal justice system from within. Harris’s campaign has pushed back on that criticism, pointing to her initiative as attorney general to start the first statewide implicit bias and procedural justice training, require body cameras for Justice Department agents, and push for data on in-custody deaths and police shootings to be made publicly available.

                "text_body": "2020 elections Presidential candidate Kamala Harris changed course on her stance on independent probes in police shootings since her days as California attorney general. | Justin Sullivan/Getty Images ByChristopher Cadelago 05/20/2019 10:16 PM EDT Link Copied Kamala Harris said police shootings and cases of alleged brutality by law enforcement officials should be handed off to independent investigators, breaking with her long-held resistance to taking prosecutorial discretion away from locally elected district attorneys. Harris, a former career prosecutor and California attorney general, had long advocated in favor of preserving prosecutorial discretion, taking heat from civil rights activists and African American leaders in her state. While running for Senate in 2016, she was criticized for withholding her support for state legislation requiring the Attorney General’s office to independently probe fatal police shootings. Now, campaigning for president, Harris was asked about her stance amid calls for more scrutiny over the investigative process. “I believe the best approach is to have independent investigations,” Harris said in a Monday interview on MSNBC. When Harris addressed the question head-on in 2014, she took the opposite approach. Harris said she didn’t think it good public policy to take the discretion from elected district attorneys. “I don’t think there’s an inherent conflict. ... Where there are abuses, we have designed the system to address them,” she told the San Francisco Chronicle. Harris never took over an officer-involved fatality investigation while serving as attorney general. But late in the 2016 Senate run, a spokeswoman for Harris told the Chronicle that the then-attorney general did advocate to the governor and Democratic legislative leaders for money in the state budget to create three new teams within her office to conduct criminal investigations of officer-involved shootings. The goal, which was never fulfilled because the budget request was denied, was to deploy state attorneys in deaths resulting from these cases, a Harris aide told POLITICO. Harris’ remarks on the subject Monday appear to be the first time she’s advocated for a blanket approach to independent probes. Pressed on her evolution on the subject, Harris pointed to a seminal case from early in her elected career. As district attorney of San Francisco, she recalled how she refused to seek the death penalty against a gang member who fatally shot a city police officer in 2004, sparking criticism from both sides. Harris noted there were calls at the time for the marquee case to be taken away from her. “I had a very real, personal experience where I had to fight to keep my case — and my argument was, ‘I was elected to exercise my discretion, and no one’s going to take my case from me,’” Harris said in the MSNBC interview. “It was that personal experience that informed my principle, which is that these cases shouldn’t be taken from the person who was elected to exercise their discretion.” But Harris said it’s now clear to her that there needs to be an independent entity brought in to probe the recurring shootings and brutality by police officers from the beginning. Such probes are needed, Harris said, “from the first moments of the incident so that we can be certain and sure that there has been a thorough investigation that is not informed by bias, and so that there will be justice for all of the people concerned.”  © 2024 POLITICO LLC"

                "text_body": "Advertisement Supported by ByAstead W. Herndon Senator Kamala Harris of California announced a plan Tuesday to heavily invest federal money into teacher pay, the first policy rollout of her campaign for the Democratic nomination for president. Ms. Harris’s proposal, which was billed as the “largest federal investment in teacher pay in U.S. history,” marks the next step for a campaign that began in February before a crowd of 20,000 supporters. [Join the conversation around the 2020 election:Sign up here for the On Politics newsletter.] In a statement detailing the proposed increase in teacher pay, Ms. Harris said that, under her administration, the Department of Education would create incentivized baselines for teacher salaries that local school districts would have to meet in order to receive certain federal funds. The average teacher in America would receive a $13,500 pay increase, the campaign said. “We have got to think about how we can bridge the gap between helplessness and hope,” Ms. Harris said at a campaign rally in Houston on Saturday, where she unveiled early portions of the teacher pay plan. “We don’t need walls. We need bridges. And that’s what we need in the next president of the United States — someone who knows how to build bridges, not walls.” The plan, which would cost more than $300 billion over 10 years, would be paid for by “strengthening the estate tax,” the Harris campaign said. The Republican-led tax reform that passed under President Trump adjusted the threshold by which the government can collect taxes from the estates of the wealthiest Americans; Ms. Harris’s proposal would reverse that change, her campaign said, in addition to closing loopholes. Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont progressive who is also running for president, released a plan to raise the estate taxearlier this yearthat would generate more than $2 trillion, according to estimates released at the time. [Who’s in? Who’s out?Keep up with the Democratic field with our candidate tracker.] Ms. Harris received considerable praise from education professionals for her proposal. Arne Duncan, the former education secretary under President Barack Obama,posted on Twitter, “Radical idea: pay the professionals we entrust to teach, nurture and mentor our children a better salary!” And Lily Eskelsen García, the president of the National Education Association,said, “This should be central to the 2020 conversation.” Teacher strikes have roiled the nation over the past year, in states governed by Republicans such as Oklahoma and Arizona and in liberal bastions like California. Though the issue has cut across culture and demographics, Ms. Harris made a particular point to highlight how low teacher wages are particularly harmful for students who are racial minorities, whose school districts then have a harder time attracting qualified educators. “You can judge a society by the way it treats its children,” Ms. Harris said in Houston. “And one of the greatest expressions of love that a society can give its children is educating those children with the resources they need.” Advertisement"

                "text_body": "As district attorney of San Francisco, Kamala Harris supported a city policy that required law enforcement to turn over undocumented juvenile immigrants to federal immigration authorities if they were arrested and suspected of committing a felony, regardless of whether they were actually convicted of a crime. Harris, who was San Francisco’s district attorney from 2004 to 2011, sided with then-Mayor Gavin Newsom in a political fight over San Francisco’s status as a sanctuary city that split the city’s municipal government, with the mayor’s office supporting the policy and the city’s elected Board of Supervisors opposing it. Harris’ past position could open her up to attacks from immigration activists as well as the more progressive wing of the party as she seeks the Democratic nomination in 2020. The fight over the San Francisco policy was covered extensively at the time, but Harris’ role has not been closely examined since she entered the national spotlight. KFile explored her position during a review of her record on immigration. In a statement to CNN, Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams said that the “policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of San Francisco and to ensure local police, who needed to have strong relationships with the communities they serve regardless of immigration status, were not forced to operate as immigration agents, which is the responsibility of the federal government. Looking back, this policy could have been applied more fairly.” Since winning election to the US Senate in 2016, Harris has established herself as an advocate for undocumented immigrants by pushing hard for a deal to protect from deportation those who came to the country as children, a group known as Dreamers. She has also called for the role of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to be re-examined. Still, her past position could prove a vulnerability in an increasingly crowded Democratic primary where candidates have been highly critical of President Donald Trump’s policies on immigration and abolishing ICE has become a popular position among the party’s base. At issue in 2008 was Newsom’s policy of reporting juvenile undocumented immigrants arrested by local police to ICE. As district attorney for San Francisco, Harris was responsible prosecuting crimes in the city. San Francisco has been asanctuary citysince 1989, meaning that police were not obligated to give any information to federal immigration authorities about interactions with undocumented residents of the city. The city’s policy was amended in 1992 to remove protections for criminal adult suspects, but the protection remained for arrested juveniles. Related articleHarris takes on questions about her 'blackness' This policy came under scrutiny in 2008 when a 21-year-old undocumented man named Edwin Ramos was arrested for murdering three members of a San Francisco family. After the news of the Ramos murders – and his previous arrest records – was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle, Newsom announced a change in the city’s policy so that police would begin reporting arrested undocumented juveniles to ICE, regardless of whether they had been found guilty in court of any crime. Ramos had previously been arrested as a youth at 17 and was found guilty of attempted robbery and assault, but he was never reported to federal immigration authorities. Up to this point in her tenure, Harris had established a record as a supporter of immigrant rights while district attorney: Shesupportedissuing specialized visas for undocumented victims of violent crimes,prosecutedan unlicensed contractor in a labor exploitation case for wage theft of immigrants, anddenouncedproposed federal legislation that would have criminalized assisting undocumented immigrants. Her office put out a statement that “We are a sanctuary city, a city of refuge, and we always will be.” Still, Harris supported Newsom’s policy change and issued astatementthat the original sanctuary law “was never intended to shield anyone from being held accountable for a crime. It’s intended to encourage immigrant victims and witnesses to report crimes without fear of reprisal so we can hold offenders accountable.” “While detained juveniles are under the custody and control of the juvenile probation office and the court every city agency needs to work together to balance our obligations under federal law and the sanctuary ordinance to solve crimes and put the offenders behind bars.” By 2009, the new policy had been in place for a year. The New York Times saidover 100juvenile suspects were reported to federal custody for deportation. Multiple juveniles faced deportation over relatively minor crimes: inone instancereported by the Times, a 14-year-old who had been in the United States since he was 2 was handed over to ICE after he took a BB gun to school to show off to friends. Inanotherinstance, a 13-year-old and his family faced deportation after he punched another boy at school and stole 46 cents. The city Board of Supervisors passedlegislationmaking it so that youths could only be reported to federal immigration authorities if convicted of a felony. After Newsom vetoed the legislation, the Board had enough votes to override his veto, and passed the law without his signature. Despite this, Newsom refused to follow the legislation and ordered the city to continue reporting undocumented juvenile suspects to ICE. During the fight between Newsom and the Board of Supervisors, Harris publicly supported Newsom and opposed the Board’s legislation. She argued her position by saying that she believed the ordinance would be in violation of federal law and would be struck down in courts. San Francisco City Attorney’s office told CNN this month that the ordinance has never been challenged in court. In aspeechat Stanford University in 2009 Harris explained her position, saying, “There was then an initiative that was written by the board of supervisors that was passed and there was opposition to that but it did pass,” Harris said. “And so we’re gonna have to wait to see how the courts interpret what it means. From my perspective, I think that it would be in conflict with federal law, and we have to follow the law. We have to follow that law. You may not agree with it, but you know, that’s why we have a process where you can challenge laws. And it is the law.” The lead figure opposing Newsom and Harris was David Campos, a former member of the Board of Supervisors who introduced and passed the legislation to protect undocumented juveniles form deportation. In a recent interview with CNN, Campos discussed the political fight and his disappointment with Harris position, and said that the two are friends who supported each other early in their political careers, but they disagreed over the issue. “I tried to reach out to her on that issue and I never really got a response from her,” Campos said. “And actually when she left the district attorney’s office, one thing that did happen was there was more openness to discussing the issue with the new D.A., when George Gascón became the district attorney after Kamala left. It was after Mayor Newsom and after Kamala Harris left that that issue potentially got resolved.” After Newsom left office in2011, his successor changed the city’s policy again so that law enforcement would only report undocumented juvenile immigrants who were arrested to ICE if they couldn’t prove family ties to the Bay Area, leading to a sharp drop in reporting. In2013, San Francisco passed another ordinance which prohibited reporting any arrested person to ICE except in limited circumstances. Newsom was attacked from both the left and right for his position during his successful run for governor of California in 2018. He ultimately admitted that the policy could have been handled differently. “These were people charged … but not convicted. Some people ultimately were exonerated that got caught up in it,” he told TheSacramento Beelast year. “I’ll just say this to my critics: fair game. Looking back, there were things we could have done differently. I’m very honest about that.” Sams, spokesman for the Harris campaign, invoked Newsom’s response in a statement to CNN, saying,  “As Governor Newsom said last year, his policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of San Francisco and to ensure local police, who needed to have strong relationships with the communities they serve regardless of immigration status, were not forced to operate as immigration agents, which is the responsibility of the federal government. Looking back, this policy could have been applied more fairly, as the governor has stated as well.” The spokesperson continued, “Senator Harris has always been a supporter of San Francisco’s commitment to protecting undocumented people and keeping communities safe, which is why as D.A. she cracked down on trafficking that preys on undocumented immigrants, prosecuted individuals scamming or exploiting undocumented immigrants, and pushed for temporary protection visas for victims of crime.” Correction: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of George Gascón's name. © 2024 Cable News Network.

                "text_body": "Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris this week mischaracterized a 2008 policy she supported that led to undocumented minors who were arrested for suspected felonies being turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement before they had been convicted of crimes. Speaking to an audience in Iowa Sunday onPolitical Party Livea podcast about Iowa politics, Harris was asked by host Misty Rebik about aCNN KFile reportdetailing Harris’ public support for a citywide policy enacted by then-Mayor Gavin Newsom of reporting juvenile undocumented immigrants arrested by local police to ICE. The decision revoked a previous policy of non-reporting. In her answer, Harris called the reporting of arrested juvenile undocumented immigrants before they were convicted of a felony an “unintended consequence” of the policy that she did not support. However, this was in fact the intent of the policy. “Could you kind of give us some insight on how, from that time, when for whatever reason you were supporting this policy that was essentially handing over undocumented people to ICE before they had been convicted to now – kind of what’s changed on that and how you came to those changes?” the questioner asked Harris. Harris responded, “That ended up being an unintended consequence of the policy and I did not support that consequence of that policy. And that policy I believe has since changed because it was not the intended purpose of that policy. I’ll say this, and I feel very strongly about it, and I always have, which is this, my background is as a prosecutor and I want to know that a person, a victim of a rape or a child molestation, or a vicious violent crime, I want to know that that victim will be able to run in the middle of the street and wave down a police officer and receive protection and security without having to worry about if they do that they will be deported.” Related articleKamala Harris supported 2008 San Francisco policy that reported arrested undocumented juveniles to ICE San Francisco had been a sanctuary city since 1989, meaning that police were not obligated to give any information to federal immigration authorities about interactions with undocumented residents of the city. The city’s policy was amended in 1992 to remove protections for criminal adult suspects, but the protection remained for arrested juveniles. Newsom changed this policy in 2008 after a 21-year-old undocumented man was arrested for murdering three members of a San Francisco family. The man had previously been arrested as a youth at 17 and was found guilty of attempted robbery and assault, but he was never reported to federal immigration authorities. After Newsom’s change, the city began reporting arrested undocumented juveniles to ICE who were suspected of committing a felony, regardless of whether they were actually found guilty of a crime. Harris’ comments mischaracterized her history on the policy. Reporting arrested undocumented juveniles to ICE was not an “unintended consequence” of the policy, it was the policy. Newsom and Harris have both since said that they supported the policy as a measure to protect San Francisco’s overall status as a sanctuary city, but the policy itself was enacted as ordered by the mayor. Newsom acknowledged during his successful run for governor of California in 2018 that the policy could have been handled differently. “These were people charged … but not convicted. Some people ultimately were exonerated that got caught up in it,” he told TheSacramento Beelast year. “I’ll just say this to my critics: fair game. Looking back, there were things we could have done differently. I’m very honest about that.” A Harris spokesman did not address the senator’s mischaracterizations when contacted by CNN’s KFile, but reiterated that the policy should have been handled differently. “As Governor Newsom has said, the initial policy was intended to protect the sanctuary status of San Francisco, which Senator Harris has always supported and defended,” Harris spokesman Ian Sams said in a statement. “We have said this policy should have been done differently, but as Senator, Harris is focused on protecting Dreamers, fighting this president’s attempts to build a vanity project on the southern border, exercising more oversight of ICE, reforming our immigration system with a path to citizenship, and reuniting families separated by this administration. Those will be her priorities should she be elected president.” Harris’ claim that the policy has since been changed “because it was not the intended purpose of that policy” is also inaccurate. While Harris was correct that the policy has since been changed, it was the result of a change in administration. When Newsom left his position as mayor in 2011, his successor changed the city’s policy so that police would only report unaccompanied juvenile undocumented immigrants who were arrested to ICE; and again in 2013 when San Francisco passed another ordinance which prohibited reporting any arrested person to ICE except in limited circumstances. There was an active push by the city’s Board of Supervisors when Harris and Newsom were in city office to change the policy to prohibit reporting juvenile undocumented immigrants to ICE unless they had been convicted of a felony. But those efforts were opposed by Harris and Newsom, with Harris saying in one speech she said the Board of Supervisors bill violated federal immigration law. When the Board passed legislation changing the policy, Newsom vetoed that legislation. The Board overrode his veto, and passed the law without his signature. Newsom ultimately enforced his original policy despite the Board’s legislation. © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 Indiana Convention Center 1:56 P.M. EDT THE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  (Applause.)  Oh, I am so honored and pleased and joyful to be with you this afternoon.  Please, have a seat. Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful day. I want to thank President Elsie Cooke-Holmes; the National Board of Directors of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated; and my Divine Nine sisters, the ladies of Delta Sigma Theta.  Good afternoon to you all.  (Applause.)Madam President, I want to thank you for your kind words.  You have been a phenomenal leader of this organization.  You and I and our other Divine Nine leaders have spent a lot of time together in Washington, D.C., and around the country.  I have seen firsthand your leadership.  It is an honor to be here with you this evening — afternoon.  Thank you.  (Applause.)So, I will say also that President Joe Biden and I have many extraordinary leaders in our Cabinet.  But as many here know, there is only one Marcia Fudge.  (Applause.) (Laughs.)  And I just — I’m going to talk about her for a minute.  Her entire career — whether as a mayor, a member of the United States Congress, a national president of Delta Sigma Theta, and now as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development — Marcia Fudge has been a champion for the people of our nation.  And she is a dear friend to me.  Thank you, Marcia Fudge.  (Applause.)So it is so wonderful to be here this afternoon with all of the leaders who are present — including, of course, the great Cheryl Johnson, who you will honor today.  (Applause.) So as a proud member of the Divine Nine, through Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated: When I look out at all of you, I see family. Like my sorority — Delta Sigma Theta, Incorporated — was founded to build networks of support for young Black college women, to fortify the bonds of sisterhood, to serve our nation and the world, and to create desperately needed social and legal change. And let’s think back to what was happening the year this storied organization was founded.  In 1913, women were not guaranteed the right to vote.  There was not a single Black person in the United States Congress.  And in that year, more than 50 Black Americans had been lynched.  And that’s only the number that was documented.And yet, despite all of this and perhaps because of it, the founders of this sorority believed in the power of sisterhood, scholarship, and service, and that they could help make real the promise of America — a promise of equality, freedom, and justice, not for some, but for all.And so, history tells us: Just two months after its founding, the members of Delta Sigma Theta marched with thousands through the streets of Washington, D.C., to demand the right for women to vote.  (Applause.) And 60 years ago this summer, in 1963, Deltas from across our country were part of the March on Washington.  Side by side with Roy Wilkins and John Lewis and Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. — (applause) — were two members of Delta Sigma Theta on that stage: Ms. Dorothy Height — (applause) — indeed — and one of the few women to speak that day, Ms. Daisy Bates.  (Applause.)And history, of course, will not let us forget that day the famous Delta Days was inaugurated in 1989 — (applause) — when, every year since, Deltas from across America convene in Washington, D.C., to uplift the issues of the moment.In fact, I remember walking through the halls of Congress when I served as a United States senator to see that powerful sea of red and then to joyfully host the California delegation in my Senate office.  (Applause.)So, that short summary of history that led us then to 2020, when, during the height of a pandemic, with a fierce commitment to our future, the leaders here registered thousands to vote, led efforts to combat voter suppression, and with our Divine Nine brothers and sisters, strolled to the polls.You showed up.  And helped elect Joe Biden President of the United States — (applause) — and me as the first Black woman to ever serve as Vice President of the United States.  (Applause.)  And so, I thank you, all the leaders here, for all you do.We all share a vision and a stake in the future of our nation — a stake and a vision in a nation where we believe all people, no matter who they are or where they start, should have the freedom to dream with ambition and where all people have access to opportunity.The great Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, a Delta and an American icon — (applause) — she once said of leadership, and I quote, “The imperative is to define what is right and to do it.”  What is right: having the courage and conviction to confront the challenges we face, confront them head on, and deal with them.So, let’s consider then the moment that we are presently in.  Well, before the President Biden and I took office, for years, too many of our seniors could not afford the medication they needed to survive.  Together, we all here declared what we know to be right: that in the United States of America, seniors should not have to choose between putting food on the table and filling their prescription.  (Applause.)  And so, President Biden and I capped the cost of insulin for our seniors at $35 a month.  (Applause.)For years, parents and grandparents across our nation have cried out about the harm of lead pipes, that half of the children in our country under the age of si- — six are at lead exposure.So, we all declared what we know to be right: Every child and every person in our nation should have clean water to drink.  And today, we are finally on track to remove every lead pipe in America.  (Applause.)For years, our HBCUs have been underfunded, even though — (applause) — even though our HBCUs are centers of outstanding academic excellence.  (Applause.)  So, when we took office, we did what we all know to be right.  President Biden and I invested nearly $7 billion in our HBCUs — (applause) — which is an investment in the future leaders of our nation.For years, our nation has ignored the crisis of maternal mortality — Madam President, you spoke of that — that before, during, and after childbirth, women in America die at a higher rate than in any other wealthy nation in the world, and that Black women are three times as likely to die.And so, when President Biden and I took office, we did what was right and made maternal health a national priority — (applause) — and expanded postpartum care through Medicaid from 2 months to 12 months, expanded it from 3 states to 35 states — (applause) — to the benefit of a half million more women in America.For far too long, our justice system has been in urgent need of reform.  Too often, bad actors have not been held accountable, including those who are sworn to protect and serve.So, when we took office, we did what we know to be right.  President Biden and I banned chokeholds and restricted no-knock warrants by federal law enforcement.  (Applause.)  And because we know much more must be done, we continue to work with civil rights leaders, law enforcement officials, and the leaders in this room to advance reforms that will build public trust and true public safety for all communities.For far too long, our justice system has not fully reflected the diversity of our nation.  So, when we took office, President Biden and I have appointed more Black women to the federal appellate courts than any other administration in history combined — (applause) — including, of course — (laughter and applause) — the first Black woman to ever sit on the highest Court of our land and your newest member, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.  (Applause.)It’s a good day.  (Laughter and applause.)So, all of this to say: The leaders in this room helped to make all of this progress possible.  And by creating a new era of impact for this historic organization, you will continue to help lead our nation forward.  And for all of that, I thank you.  And I am also here to declare: We have more work to do, being clear-eyed — (applause) — being clear-eyed about the moment we are in and the challenges we face. We can see, right now in our country, so many of our hard-won freedoms are under full on attack.Just consider: Last year, the highest Court in our land, the historic Court of Thurgood, took a constitutional right that had been recognized from the people of America — from the women of America.  And since then, in extremist measures, extremist leaders in states across our nation — states like Indiana — have passed laws that criminalize doctors and punish women. And on this issue, I know we are all clear: One does not have to abandon their faith or deeply held beliefs to agree the government should not be telling a woman what to do with her body.  (Applause.)  And yet, today, on this subject, extremists pass laws with no exception even for rape or incest.Now, as many of you know, I started my career as a prosecutor and I specialized in violent crimes against women and children.  It is simply immoral that after someone has survived an act of incredible violence and violation to their body, that they do not get to decide what happens to their body next.  That is immoral.  (Applause.)Hard-won freedoms are under attack.Just consider: Today, in states across our nation, extremists attack the freedom to vote.  They pass laws that ban drop boxes and limit early voting — laws that make it illegal to simply give somebody food and water while they stand in line for hours to cast their ballot.  (Applause.)Extremists pass laws that target our friends and neighbors because of who they are and who they love.  And at this moment in our country, we just witnessed the United States Supreme Court strike down affirmative action, give businesses the right to discriminate, and deny debt relief to millions of Americans with student loans. All the while, these same extremists, in most cases, refuse to pass reasonable gun safety laws to keep our children safe.  (Applause.) And speaking of our children, extremists pass book bans to prevent them from learning our true history — book bans in this year of our Lord 2023.  And while they do this, check it out, they push forward revisionist history.  Just yesterday, in the State of Florida, they decided middle school students will be taught that enslaved people benefited from slavery. They insult us in an attempt to gaslight us, and we will not stand for it — (applause) — we who share a collective experience in knowing we must honor history and our duty in the context of legacy.There is so much at stake in this moment: our most basic rights and freedoms, fact versus fiction, foundational principles about what it means to be a democracy.And so, in this moment, our nation again counts on the leaders in this room — those who stand on the great shoulders of the great American leaders like Ida B. Wells, Dorothy Height, and Shirley Chisholm — (applause); who, with courage, determination, and fortitude continue to organize, build coalitions, and activate our communities.Let us continue to stand together and fight for what is right.Because we do know: It is right to fight for the freedom of every woman to control her own body — not her government.  (Applause.)  It is right to fight for a future in which every person can live free from discrimination and hate.  It is right to fight for safe communities.  It is right to fight for paid leave and clean water and affordable childcare.  It is right to fight to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.  It is right to fight against book bans and the truth.  (Applause.) So, Delta Sigma Theta, let us fight fueled by the love of our children.  Let us fight fueled by the love of our country.  And let us fight with the knowledge and the faith that when we fight, we win.  (Applause.)God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you all.  (Applause.)END                  2:15 P.M.

The changes to Florida’s teaching standards come as DeSantis and other state leaders have put an intense focus on what students are learning about race in the classroom. | Meg Kinnard/AP Photo ByAndrew Atterbury 07/20/2023 02:53 PM EDT Link Copied Florida education officials approved new standards for teaching African American history Wednesday in response to the “anti-woke” policies touted by Gov. Ron DeSantis as critics urged the state to rethink the curriculum claiming that it “only presents half the story and half the truth.” Thenew standards, backed unanimously by the state Board of Education, encompass the controversial 2022 law regulating how race can be taught in Florida schools — something that was specifically sought by the Republican governor and presidential contender. Board members and state officials defended the updated curriculum that they say touches on the “darkest” parts of U.S. history against charges by opponents, including the state’s largest teachers union, that the changes are an attempt to “whitewash” what students are learning. “It’s the good, the bad and the ugly in American history,” Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. said at Wednesday’s board meeting in Orlando. The changes to Florida’s teaching standards come as DeSantis and other state leaders have put an intense focus on what students are learning about race in the classroom. The state tweaked its history curriculum to match the so-called Stop WOKE law that takes aim at lessons over issues like “white privilege” by creating new protections for students and workers, including that a person should not be instructed to “feel guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress” due to their race, color, sex or national origin. The law specifically requires schools to teach about how freedoms have been infringed by sexism, slavery, racial oppression, racial segregation and racial discrimination — and be delivered in an “age-appropriate manner.” As such, some critics of the new standards argue that necessary topics have been “aged up” to older students and “watered down.” Several speakers at Wednesday’s meeting pointed to specific pieces of the new standards they considered questionable, joining the Florida Education Association union and the NAACP Florida State Conference, among other groups, in opposing the curriculum they claim will “purposefully omit or rewrite key historical facts about the Black experience.” The opposition included local Democratic state lawmakers Rep. Anna Eskamani (D-Orlando) and Sen. Geraldine Thompson (D-Orlando), who both spoke at the meeting. Some of the issues raised surrounded standards that include instruction on “how slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit” and lessons that touch on acts of violence perpetrated “against and by” African Americans. Further, opponents took aim at how the standards approach Black history lessons for younger students, which largely required them to “recognize” Black inventors, explorers and artists. “These standards in kindergarten through fourth grade simply ask our students to recognize and identify,” Elizabeth Albert, an elementary teacher and president of the Volusia United Educators union, told the board Wednesday. “As a teacher, we focus on the verb in the standards, and these are the lowest level of cognitive rigor.” State board members and officials, however, pushed back on the arguments against the standards, contending that they “do not teach that slavery was beneficial.” “Everything is there,” said board member Kelly Garcia, a certified teacher from the Tampa area who was appointed by DeSantis in March. “The darkest parts of our history are addressed.” Diaz, meanwhile, used the curriculum discussion to take a shot at the FEA union for blasting anopposition letterhe said “did not provide any substantive issue or articulate a single reason to actually reject the standards.” Florida’s Republican leaders have frequently clashed with teachers unions over issues like reopening schools during the pandemic, which the unions opposed, and teacher salary negotiations the state believes take too long. “This is the same union that brought frivolous lawsuits on the back of their members’ hard-earned dues,” Diaz said. “Again, time after time, we’ve defeated them in court. What are they fighting this time?” Florida is currently blocked from enforcing its anti-woke law in colleges and universities amid a federal lawsuit that is tied up in appeals court. Aside from that law, the state also engaged in a high-profile dispute with the nonprofit College Board after state Education Department officials rejected its African American studies AP program for initially including coursework on queer theory and other aspects it deemed objectionable.  © 2024 POLITICO LLC"

                "text_body": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Florida’s public schoolswill now teach students that some Black people benefited from slavery because it taught them useful skills,part of new African American history standardsapproved Wednesday that were blasted by a state teachers' union as a “step backward.” The Florida State Board of Education’s new standards includes controversial language about how “slaves developed skills which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit,” according to a216-page documentabout the state’s 2023 standards in social studies, posted by the Florida Department of Education. Other language that has drawn the ire of some educators and education advocates includes teaching about how Black people were also perpetrators of violence during race massacres. That language says, “Instruction includes acts of violence perpetrated against and by African Americans but is not limited to 1906 Atlanta Race Riot, 1919 Washington, D.C. Race Riot, 1920 Ocoee Massacre, 1921 Tulsa Massacre and the 1923 Rosewood Massacre.” The Florida Education Association, a statewide teachers’ union representing about 150,000 teachers, called the new standards “a disservice to Florida’s students and are a big step backwardfor a state that has required teaching African American history since 1994.” “How can our students ever be equipped for the future if they don’t have a full, honest picture of where we’ve come from? Florida’s students deserve a world-class education that equips them to be successful adults who can help heal our nation’s divisions rather than deepen them,” Andrew Spar, president of the union, said in the statement. “Gov. DeSantis is pursuing a political agenda guaranteed to set good people against one another, and in the process he’s cheating our kids,\" Spar said. \"They deserve the full truth of American history, the good and the bad.” The union said it is troubling that at the high school level, the standards conflate the 1920 Ocoee Massacre, when at least 30 African Americans were killed for attempting to vote, with “acts of violence perpetrated by African Americans.” And in middle school, the standards require students be taught slavery was beneficial to African Americans because it helped them develop skills, the union said. Updates to the African American history curriculum were required by a controversial 2022 law that Gov. Ron DeSantis dubbed the “Stop Wrongs To Our Kids and Employees Act,” or “Stop WOKE Act,”NBC South Floridareported. A spokesperson from the Florida Department of Education on Thursday provided a response to NBC News’ questions through a statement from Dr. William Allen and Dr. Frances Presley Rice, who are members of Florida’s African American History Standards Workgroup. The new standards were defended in the statement as “comprehensive and rigorous instruction on African American History. We proudly stand behind these African American History Standards,” the statement said. “The intent of this particular benchmark clarification is to show that some slaves developed highly specialized trades from which they benefitted. This is factual and well documented,\" it added. The statement continued, “Some examples include: blacksmithslikeNed Cobb, Henry Blair, Lewis Latimer and John Henry; shoemakerslikeJames Forten, Paul Cuffe and Betty Washington Lewis; fishing and shipping industry workers like Jupiter Hammon, John Chavis, William Whipper and Crispus Attucks; tailors like Elizabeth Keckley, James Thomas and Marietta Carter; and teacherslikeBetsey Stockton and Booker T. Washington.” It’s “disappointing” that some detractors would devalue the research from the work group and reduce it to “a few isolated expressions without context,\" the statement said. A representative for Gov. DeSantis could be immediately reached for comment Thursday. In January,DeSantis’ administration blocked a new Advanced Placement course on African American studies from being taught in high schools, saying it violates state law and was historically inaccurate. The state pointing tosix areas of concernand works by Kimberlé W. Crenshaw, bell hooks, Angela Davis and other Black authors. That same month, DeSantis and Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr.discussed the issue at a news conference. They said that the course was a Trojan horse for “indoctrinating” students with a left-wing ideology under the guise of teaching about the Black experience and African American history.

                "title": "Fact-checking presidential candidates at the CNN climate town hall | CNN Politics",
                "text_body": "CNN hosted apresidential town hallWednesday night in New York City focused on the climate crisis. The event featured ten 2020 Democratic candidates, each of whom appeared on stage individually and took questions directly from a live studio audience — composed of Democratic voters interested in the issue —  as well as CNN moderators. We watched all seven hours. Here are the facts around some of their claims: Sen. Kamala Harris, who formerly served as California’s attorney general, was asked what she would do about “disinformation campaigns” from big businesses about the climate crisis. She advocated suing companies that have caused harm to people, just as “we did with the tobacco companies.” Asked if that would mean suing ExxonMobil, Harris responded, “I have sued ExxonMobil.” Facts First:Though Harris has sued other big oil companies, she has not sued ExxonMobil. When CNN asked what Harris was referring to, campaign press secretary Ian Sams emailed us a 2016 article about her decision as attorney general to begin aninvestigationinto whether ExxonMobil lied to the public and shareholders about its knowledge of the risks posed by climate change. But she did not file a lawsuit before she left the post to become a senator in 2017, and her successor as attorney general has also not done so. As Sams noted, Harris did take legal action against oil companies on multiple occasions as attorney general. For example, afterfiling lawsuits, she secured a$14 million settlementfrom BP and Atlantic Richfield Company and a$11.5 million settlementwith Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips over allegations that they had violated laws governing underground fuel tanks. Still, her claim at the town hall was that she sued ExxonMobil in particular, and it is false. RL Miller, chair of the California Democratic Party’s environmental caucus and president of the Climate Hawks Vote Super PAC, said onTwitterduring the town hall: “As Cal AG, Harris opened a file shortly after the #ExxonKnew news broke in fall 2015. She never did anything with it.” The attorney general of New Yorkfileda lawsuit against ExxonMobil in October 2018. Harris’ successor, Xavier Becerra,declinedto immediately join the lawsuit. ExxonMobil denies any wrongdoing. The company says on itswebsite: “#ExxonKnew is an orchestrated campaign that seeks to delegitimize ExxonMobil and misinterpret our climate change position and research. For the past several years, activist organizations have sought to punish ExxonMobil for voicing its opinion on climate policy, even though ExxonMobil supports policies to limit climate change.” In discussing air pollution, Harris brought up the progress Los Angeles has made in cleaning up its air. “Have any of you gone out to Los Angeles, California, about 20 years ago and remember what that sky looked like? It was brown. Babies had asthma. There were warnings that seniors should not go outside because breathing that … would cause incredible damage to their lungs. And then leaders lead; the public said enough. You look up at the sky in Los Angeles today it’s blue.” Facts First:The claim about Los Angeles’s present-day skies is an exaggeration. Harris was correct that LA’s skies are less polluted than they were 20 years ago, but it remains one of themost pollutedcities in the country. Air quality hasimprovedin LA and in many cities around the country since the 1990s. This is largely due tobetter air quality-control policiesat the federal, state and local levels. The improvement in air quality has had a positive health impact on LA residents.Studies showbetter lung function in children who live in the region. Those bluer skies, though, are stillextremely polluted. The Los Angeles area has the worst level of ozone pollution in the country, according to the annual American Lung Association’s State of the Airreport.Ozone, also called smog, essentially causes asunburnof the lung, irritating and inflaming the lining of our lungs when we breathe it in. It can leave us winded, cause asthmaattacks, make us more susceptible to infection and even shorten our lives. Related articleCNN's climate crisis town hall In 2018, the regionviolatedfederal smog standards 87 days in a row, the longest stretch in 20 years. The Los Angeles area is fifth worst for year-round particle pollution and seventh for short-term particle pollution, according to the annual State of the Air report. Particle pollution is the mix of solid and liquid droplets in the air,accordingto the US Environmental Protection Agency. It can come in the form of dirt, dust, soot or smoke. Particle pollution comes from coal- and natural gas-fired plants, cars, agriculture, unpaved roads and construction sites. California, while typically progressive on environmental issues, appears a disproportionate number of times on these bad air lists. It’s in part because of topography that traps ozone and pollution. The sunny, warm climatedoesn’t helpand neither do the pollution-generating activities of the39 million peopleliving there. Cars, trucks, factories, oil and gas extraction, and power plants all create pollution. Wildfiresare also a big source of air pollution and are becoming a bigger problem with the climate crisis. During his town hall, businessman Andrew Yang claimed that the Green New Deal – a Democratic resolution to address climate change – called for banning air travel. “I love the vision of the Green New Deal,” Yang said. “But the timeline they put out there would do away with commercial air travel and a lot of other things in a particular time frame.” Facts First:While an FAQ on the Green New Deal that circulated earlier this year did mention getting rid of emissions from air travel, the actual resolution does not. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who introduced the resolution in the House, had anFAQreleased on her government webpage which explained that the resolution called for net-zero emissions in 10 years instead of zero emissions because “we aren’t sure that we will be able to fully get rid of, for example, emissions from cows or air travel before then.” The FAQ was not an official part of the GND and Democrats who supported the resolution did not endorse it. The FAQ has since been removed. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted that “there are multiple doctored GND resolutions and FAQs floating around. There was also a draft version that got uploaded + taken down.” She then pointed to the actual resolution which does not mandate that air travel be banned within a certain time period as Yang claimed. It does however call for “achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions” through “a 10-year national mobilization effort” as thesummaryof the bill notes. Both South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former congressman Beto O’Rourke said climate change contributed to causing the Syrian civil war. “Let’s talk about national security, at a time when our military leaders say that this (climate change) is one of the greatest threats to stability. There’s a lot of evidence that the Syrian civil war was one of the first that was partly caused as a consequence of climate change,” Buttigieg said. O’Rourke was more definitive, omitting the “partly.” “There will be a fierce competition for resources on this planet. Wars that were precipitated by climate change, like Syria, will pale in comparison to the wars that we see in the future,” O’Rourke said. Facts First:Buttigieg and O’Rourke did not invent this claim: scholars have published research arguing that climate change did contribute to creating the social conditions that led to the outbreak of the Syrian civil war. Other scholars, however, have argued that there is insufficient evidence for this conclusion. The general argument from climate scientists who agree with Buttigieg and O’Rourke is this: Syria’s major multi-year drought,which started in 2006, was made more likely and more severe because of climate change; this drought caused poverty and hunger that led to significant internal migration from rural areas to cities; these issues fueled the social unrest that sparked the 2011 protests that led to the war. In apaperpublished in 2015 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), scholars from the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Columbia University noted that “civil unrest can never be said to have a simple or unique cause,” and that Syria’s was no exception. But they wrote that “the drought had a catalytic effect” on unrest in Syria, and that the severity and duration of the drought were “more than twice as likely as a consequence of human interference in the climate system.” In apaperpublished in 2017 in the journal Political Geography, scholars on the other side, from the University of Sussex, University of Hamburg and elsewhere, wrote that “there is no clear and reliable evidence that anthropogenic climate change was a factor in Syria’s pre-civil war drought; that this drought did not cause anywhere near the scale of migration that is often alleged; and that there exists no solid evidence that drought migration pressures in Syria contributed to civil war onset.” Regardless, it is clear thatpolitical factorsunrelated to climate change, such as decades of repression from President Bashar al-Assad and his predecessor and late father Hafez al-Assad, contributed to producing the Syrian uprising. Versions of Buttigieg and O’Rourke’s claims have previously been made by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry. Obama, unlike the two 2020 candidates,acknowledgedthat the research finding a link between the war and climate change was “not definitive.” But he called it “powerful.” While discussing the difficulty of storing nuclear waste, Harris claimed that the Trump administration put waste in Yucca Mountain, Nevada, in the middle of the night. “They were, in the middle of the night – this administration,” Harris said, “in the middle of the night, carting in waste into Yucca mountain without the authority and the permission of the leaders of the state of Nevada.” Facts First:The Trump administration has not moved any nuclear waste to Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, secretly or otherwise. In 2018, the federal government did move weapons-grade plutonium – not waste – to a different location, the Nevada National Security Site, without alerting the state’s government. The federal government has long had an eye on Yucca Mountain as a potential place to store nuclear waste; however, efforts have been continually held up. As the Yucca Mountain Information Office notes on its website, Yucca Mountain has no existing infrastructure to transport or store waste inside the mountain. “Today, the only thing that actually exists at Yucca Mountain is (a) single 5 mile exploratory tunnel,” the websitestates. In 2017, a US district court in South Carolinaorderedthe federal government to remove at least 1 metric ton of plutonium from the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. As a result, in 2018, the Energy Department moved half a metric ton of plutonium from the South Carolina site and onto the Nevada National Security Site, a federal nuclear laboratory. The move was made without alerting Nevada state authorities. The State of Nevada filed a lawsuit in November 2018 to stop the potential transportation of the plutonium, but the Department of Energy – in documentsreleasedin January as part of the lawsuit – said that the plutonium had already been shipped. At the time, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Chief of Staff William White noted in a letter that the plutonium is not waste and will eventually “be used for vital national security missions.” In response to the revelation that the shipment had already been completed, US Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevadatweetedin January that “it’s unconscionable that (the DOE and NNSA) failed to disclose the shipment of weapons grade plutonium to Nevada.” In their courtfilings, the DOE said that it does not “release information about the status of the shipment(s) until sometime after the shipping ‘campaign’ is concluded.” The Harris campaign declined to comment.

                "text_body": "In a dramatic moment of the Democratic primarydebate on Thursday night, California Sen. Kamala Harris confrontedformer Vice President Joe Bidenabout his history of opposition to “busing,” the policy of transporting students to schools outside their neighborhoods to try to reduce racial segregation. Harris said she was herself part of a busing program in California. She also said she was part of only the second integrated class at her school. California-based radio host Larry Elder and others, citing a post on the conspiracy-minded conservative website Gateway Pundit, accused her of lying about her school’s integration history. She was not lying. In fact, the school district confirmed her claim to CNN. Facts First:Harris was indeed part of the second integrated class at Berkeley’s Thousand Oaks Elementary School: she entered school in 1969, and the plan to desegregate the school was implemented in 1968. “Thousand Oaks Elementary, along with all Berkeley public elementary schools, were integrated through a two-way busing plan, beginning in 1968, so Senator Harris is correct in describing her experience in 1969 as the second year of the busing integration program,” Natasha Beery, director of community relations for the Berkeley Unified School District, said in an email on Friday. Here’s whatHarris said to Biden: “But I also believe, and it’s personal – and I was actually very – it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing. And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.” Related articleBiden on debate moment: 'I heard and I listened to and I respect Sen. Harris' Elder was touting a viral Gateway Pundit article, shared thousands of times on Facebook, that alleged that Berkeley’s school integration occurred before she was even born in 1964. The article included a photo from the 1963 yearbook from Berkeley’s high school, which showed many black students. The key words here: high school. Berkeley High was, and is, the only public high school in the city, so it was integrated by necessity. As the local newswebsite Berkeleysidehas repeatedly pointed out, the local elementary schools were different. The NAACP and others had complained for years that these schools were segregated. In 1962, the school board appointed a group to study the issue, calling it the Citizens’ Committee on De Facto Segregation. The segregation in the city was indeed de facto segregation, not the officially mandated segregation imposed by law in the South, so there were some minority students at Harris’ school long before she arrived. In 1963, according to data published by the school district, there were 15 “Negro” students at Thousand Oaks Elementary – just 2.5 percent of the student body. By contrast, there were 561 “Caucasian” students, 95.1 percent. Citing such data, the committee concluded that 14 of the 17 district elementary schools were effectively segregated. Seeking to rectify the situation, the school board voted unanimously in early 1968 in favor of a busing plan in which more than 3,000 students, both black and white, would be bused to different communities. “In Berkeley, we only have one comprehensive high school, so it was integrated by default (de facto). Our elementary schools, however, reflected the racial composition of our neighborhoods, which like many neighborhoods across America reflected the history of segregation stemming from policies which restricted the opportunities of non-white residents,” Beery said. Harris, born to a black father and a mother from India, lived at the time in an apartment on Bancroft Way in a part of town known as the flatlands, which had a large black population. Minority children in that area were bused to affluent white communities, such as the one where Thousand Oaks was located. “Kamala and I took the bus to Thousand Oaks School in Berkeley together,” Carole Porter said in an email. “She lived around the corner from me on Bancroft, I grew up on Browning Street. We caught the bus to Thousand Oaks School in Berkeley on the corner of Bancroft and Browning St. every weekday morning.” By 1969, Thousand Oaks was up to 40.2 percent “Negro” and down to 53.4 percent “Caucasian,” according to the school district.

                "text_body": "In an interview with CNN on Monday,Sen. Kamala Harrisargued that President Donald Trump has failed to deliver on his promises to workers. And she issued a dire warning about autoworkers’ jobs in particular. “He said he was going to help working people, and it is estimated that as many as 300,000 autoworkers may be out of a job before the end of the year,” she said aboard her campaign bus in Iowa. That was a more conservative figure than HarrisusedJuly 12 on the radio show “The Breakfast Club,” during which she said, “He’s helped the top 1% and the biggest corporations. Meanwhile, some estimate that as many as 700,000 autoworkers were going to lose their job before the end of the year.” Both figures are incorrect. Facts First:There is no credible estimate that 300,000 autoworkers might lose their jobs by the end of the year. And there has been an increase in autoworker jobs during the Trump presidency, though there has been a slight decrease over the past year. We can’t fact-check the future of automotive employment; anything is possible, even a sudden depression. But Harris was wrong to claim that experts are suggesting there might be a massive decline in autoworker jobs within five months. Harris’ campaign told CNN that the “300,000” figure came from astudypublished in February by the Center for Automotive Research. That study, however, estimated approximately 367,000 job losses in the entire economy, not among autoworkers in particular. And the estimate was for job losses a year after Trump imposed a 25% tariff on automobiles and auto parts from every country except for Canada, Mexico and South Korea – which he has not done. Kristin Dziczek, a co-author of the study and the Center for Automotive Research’s vice president for industry, labor and economics, said the center has not published a specific job-loss estimate for autoworkers. But she said it is “highly unlikely” there would be a loss even close to 300,000 autoworkers by the year’s end. The number of people employed in “production and nonsupervisory roles” making automobiles and auto parts – plant workers, in other words – did fall over the last year, from 648,100 in June 2018 to 640,200 in June 2019, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data. But that’s a decrease of about 1%, nothing approaching the catastrophic collapse Harris suggested might be coming. “The sector is starting to shrink,” Dziczek said, but a rapid loss of 300,000 autoworker jobs “would be orders of magnitude worse than what we’re expecting to see.” Dziczek said that 90% of the hypothetical 367,000 job losses in the February study were attributable to the possibility of Trump imposing the 25% tariff. Trump could certainly still impose such a tariff, but he decided in mid-May to delay a decision for six months. So even if there were 300,000 job losses throughout the economy after a hypothetical tariff did come into effect, the delay means they would be highly unlikely to occur by the end of 2019. Harris’ “700,000” figure relied on apreviousCenter for Automotive Research study, published in July 2018, that estimated a loss of more than 700,000 jobs if Trump imposed a 25% tariff on automobile and auto parts imports from every country. This estimate, too, was for all kinds of jobs, not autoworkers alone, and the Center for Automotive Research says it has been supplanted by the updated analysis in the February 2019 study. Trump has made false claims about his record on auto jobs – inaccuratelyboasting, among other things, that new auto plants are being built in places like Florida and Pennsylvania. But he is correct when he says auto jobs have been created during his tenure. In June, there were 195,600 production and nonsupervisory employeesinvolved in the manufacturing of motor vehicles, up 14% from 171,000 in January 2017. For production and nonsupervisory employeesinvolved in parts manufacturing, it was 444,600 in June, down 2% from 454,500 in January 2017. Still, for vehicles and parts manufacturingas a whole, including supervisory workers and people involved in manufacturing bodies and trailers, there were 1,005,500 people employed as of July, up 5% from 955,800 in January 2017. Harris could fairly argue that Trump has had a modest impact on industry employment. But she is wrong in suggesting that experts believe he might cause autoworker employment to plunge within months.

EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, NAN!  (Applause.)  Good afternoon.  Please have a seat.  Please have a seat.AUDIENCE MEMBER:  We love you!THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I love you.  (Applause.)Oh, good afternoon.  Well, let me start by thanking the members of our administration who are here, members of Congress who are here, members of the clergy, and all of the leaders who are here today.  It is truly, truly my honor to be with everyone as we celebrate 32 years of the National Action Network.  (Applause.)Rev, I love you.  (Laughter.)  And I thank you on behalf of all of us — everyone — for all that you do and all that you are.  And as I have said in public and in private many times: Rev, no matter where you are, you are always a voice of truth, speaking about the importance of justice for all people.  You are part of the conscience of our country.  And I thank you for all that you do.  (Applause.)So, as we all know, last week we marked the 55th anniversary of the assassination of Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.  And every year, NAN holds this conference in April to honor Dr. King’s legacy.So, I’ll tell you, I have been reflecting recently that among Dr. King’s many gifts was his ability to understand the present moment in the context of a vision for a better future.So, NAN, in that spirit then, let us clearly understand the moment we are in — a moment in which our hard-won freedoms are under attack.Because just look at where we are.  Extremists across our country attack the freedom to vote.  They ban books to attempt to erase America’s full history.  They attack the ability of people to love openly and with pride.  They attack the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body instead of the government.  They attack medication that for 20 years the FDA ruled as being safe.And just yesterday, in Florida, extremists there signed a six-week ban before most women even know they are pregnant.And, NAN, isn’t it interesting that in the midst of all these attacks on fundamental freedoms, these so-called leaders dare to tell us they are fighting for our freedoms.  Don’t you find that interesting?Some have gone so far as to name and brand their agenda the, quote, “Freedom Blueprint.”Don’t fall for the “okey-doke.”  (Laughter and applause.)  Don’t fall for the “okey-doke.”Because as we know, freedom — well, it doesn’t censor books.  Freedom does not criminalize doctors and punish women.  Freedom does not turn off a microphone when an elected leader is speaking.  (Applause.)And, you see, as Dr. King made clear, freedom includes the ability of all people to fully exercise their rights — rights that generations of Americans bled and died for, rights that the people in this very room continue to march and fight for.That is our nation’s freedom blueprint.  And that is what we stand for.And I do believe that when you know what you stand for, you know what to fight for.  (Applause.)And so, NAN, two of the many important fights before us — I could go on all day if we were to articulate all of them — but two of them I’m going to talk about this afternoon.One, the fight for our children and all people to be free from gun violence.  (Applause.)  And, two, the fight for freedom to fully participate in a democracy.  (Applause.)  Both fights fully on display these last few weeks.So, just think: In our country, already, in the 104 days of this year, there have been more than 150 mass shootings — already this year.Just think.  You’ve seen the statistics.  Gun violence is now the number-one cause for death of children in our nation.  And a heartbreaking one in five Americans has lost a family member to gun violence.And, you know, while all this violence impacts all communities in devastating ways, we know it does not do so equally.  Black people are only 13 percent of America’s population but more than 60 percent of homicide victims from gun violence.Meanwhile, as Rev said, we speak here while the NRA is holding its convention in Indiana.Now, you know what they’ve called it?  They have called it a, quote, “freedom-filled weekend.”So, we must ask: “Freedom-filled” for who, exactly?  Because it’s not for parents who pray that their children will come home from school safe from a classroom in Uvalde or Nashville.  Not for those who pray that their loved ones will come home safe from a bank in Louisville, Kentucky, from a grocery store in Buffalo, or from everyday gun violence in communities across our nation.Let us all declare: Enough is enough.  (Applause.)  Enough is enough.And here’s the thing: The solutions — because there’s clearly a problem — the solutions are clear.  We must have reasonable gun safety laws at the state and the federal level.And, by the way, most gun owners agree.  Even the majority of NRA members support background checks for all gun purchases.So, let’s reject the false choice that some are pushing to suggest that you’re either in favor of upholding the Second Amendment or you’re in favor of passing reasonable gun safety laws.  Let us reject that false choice.  We’re not falling for the “okey-doke.”And let us continue to demand that leaders step up and show some courage in statehouses and in the United States Congress — (applause) — to make background checks universal, repeal the liability shield that protects gun manufacturers, and to renew the assault weapons ban.  (Applause.)And I see there are a lot of cameras here, so I’ll say this.  For everyone watching — (laughter and applause) — for everyone watching, please be clear: The voices of students, parents, teachers, and preachers will not be silenced, and these voices must be heard.  (Applause.)  These voices must be heard.  They will not be discouraged or deterred, even if using a bullhorn becomes necessary!  (Applause.)  These voices will not be silenced.So, it’s an issue of public safety.And we also know, here at NAN and all over our country, I do believe, that the right to public safety is not only about the freedom to learn in a classroom without fear of an active shooter.But it is also freedom to drive to one’s mother’s house without being killed by five lawless officers in a, quote, “SCORPIONs” unit.  (Applause.)Rev, you and I were in together in Memphis when you eulogized Tyre Nichols.  And I will say today what I said that day: When we talk about public safety, was not Tyre a member of the public?  Was not Tyre also entitled to the right to be safe?And so, then, in the name of public safety, can’t we all agree that when there is biased policing and excessive force that it must be met with accountability?  (Applause.)Can’t we all agree that there is much we must do to increase public safety and that that includes the need for Congress to pass comprehensive police reform legislation?  (Applause.)The kind of commonsense reform that, by the way, many police officers themselves, including the Major Cities Chiefs Association, have called for.So, we’re talking about members of Congress.  We’re talking about statehouse legislatures.  There’s a theme here: They’re all elected by the people — by the people.And NAN, change comes in many ways.  And one of the most direct is through the ballot box.  (Applause.)Because in 2020 — let’s reflect — in 2020 — and I’m looking with thanks at the leaders in this room — in 2020, because people stood in line for hours and voted, Joe Biden and I went to the White House.  (Applause.)And in 2022, because people voted, women’s reproductive freedom in every state ballot, from Kentucky to California, was protected.  (Applause.)We won races for secretary of state, attorney general, and governor.We flipped legislative chambers in three states and expanded our majority in the United States Senate.  (Applause.)So, I say:  When we vote, we win.  We win.  (Applause.)And, of course, then for our right to vote to have meaning, the people we elect, the people who reflect our values and represent our voices — well, they too must be heard.  That, too, is what democracy is about.However, that too has come under attack.  And that was what Nashville was all about: an attempt to silence the voices of the people.Now, can you imagine — the voice of the people was too much for these extremists to handle.  It was just too much; they couldn’t bear it.But you see, the Tennessee Three clearly were not deterred.  (Applause.)But those extremists couldn’t handle it, so much so that they turned off the microphones.  (Applause.)But the Tennessee Three said, “All right, let’s pull out that bullhorn because we will be heard.”  (Applause.)  And they channeled the cries and the pleas and the demands of the people, and required that those voices be heard.And then what happened?  For only the fourth time in nearly 160 years, there was a vote there in Tennessee to expel elected legislators from their seats — two young Black men.But 7,000 students and parents continued to march and organize and raise their voices.  (Applause.)  And now, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson are back in their seats!  (Applause.)  That’s right.The people spoke.  The people spoke.And that, however, was just the most recent attack that we have seen in an attempt to silence the voice of the people — which, by the way, let’s all be clear and we know is an attack on democracy itself.And just go back two years to see the pattern.  We can go farther back than that, but let’s just go back two years.  In 2020, NAN helped turn out record numbers of voters during the height of a pandemic.  (Applause.)A vote that you anticipated and did result in, for example, an historic $5.8 billion invested in our HBCUs.  (Applause.)A vote that resulted in the first Black woman to serve on the United States Supreme Court.  Her name is Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.  (Applause.)Resulted in a cap on the insulin at $35 a month for our seniors.  (Applause.)A vote that resulted in the lowest rate of Black unemployment in the history of the United States of America.Well, the promise — the very promise of that progress from that vote scared a whole lot of people.And so what did they do almost immediately after the 2020 election?  In states around our country, extremist so-called leaders started to ban drop boxes; reject mail-in ballots; and even make it a crime to give food and water to people standing in line to vote; proposed and passed undemocratic laws — un-American laws.But in a democracy, there are still checks and balances.  And so, to respond to these threats to democracy, because you voted in 2020 and we now have a Department of Justice that actually believes in the pursuit of justice — (applause) — we were able to double the size of the Department of Justice’s team on voting rights enforcement.  Checks and balances.Checks and balances also require that Congress do its job and pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the Freedom to Vote Act.  (Applause.)So while we are clear-eyed and see the moment we are in and, in particular, the attacks on our democracy and our foundational principles and values — while we fight off these attacks, I will also say, NAN, we must also keep our eye on the affirmative agenda.  We got to do both.Because remember: Dr. King, when he was assassinated, was on the verge of the next phase in the rights that he was fighting for all Americans that are about civil rights.  And he was combining that fight for civil rights and justice with the fight for economic justice.And as Dr. King said in Memphis, we must continue the fight for economic justice as part of our fight for civil rights.And economic justice then, we know, is our collective commitment to equity and to make sure all people have access to opportunity.  (Applause.)It is the fight for paid leave and affordable child care; to permanently expand the Child Tax Credit; to cancel student loan debt; to provide access to capital for small-business owners and entrepreneurs; to make sure all families can buy a home; and to protect Social Security and Medicare from attack.  (Applause.)We got to keep our eye on our affirmative agenda while we are handling all those attacks.  Because we will not fully, I believe, achieve the dream of freedom until it includes economic justice for all — a justice that protects the dignity of work and basic rights of all people.So, in conclusion, NAN, there’s a lot I could say, but I’m just going to go with this.  (Laughter.)  I think there is one bottom line that is for sure: We all love our country.  We do.  We love our country.  That’s why we fight so hard.  (Applause.)  We love our country.   And we stand in the long tradition of those who have faithfully believed in the founding principles of our nation.But at this moment, the founding principles are under attack.  And I believe always and especially today that the strength of our nation depends on us each to fulfill our duty — yes, I said “our duty” — to stand and protect our democracy.  (Applause.)And so, specifically then, I will speak to the young leaders who are here.  And, Rev, you are always lifting up our young leaders.  (Applause.)  Remember — to the young leaders I say, remember: Reverend Sharpton was only 16 when he founded his first organization, the National Youth Movement.  Sixteen.  (Applause.)  Diane Nash was just 21 years old when she led the Nashville sit-ins.  John Lewis was only 23 when he spoke during the March on Washington.And it is no coincidence that the two expelled members of the Tennessee Three are both in their twenties.  (Applause.)So, to our young leaders, I say: We hear you.  We support you.  And we need you.  We need you.  We are all in this together, and we need you.  (Applause.)So, to everyone here, I say: Thank you.  And God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.  Thank you.  (Applause.)END                 12:38 P.M.

                "title": "Minimum wage workers can’t afford a modest 2-bedroom home anywhere in the country, report says | CNN",
                "text_body": "There’s not a single state, county or metropolitan area in the entire United States where a full-time worker earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour can afford a modest 2-bedroom apartment. And if those workers wanted to? They’d have to work 122 hours a week. Every week. All year. This is according toa new reportfrom the National Low Income Housing Coalition, or NLIHC, which calls attention to the gap between low-income wages and the high cost of rent throughout much of the United States. The NLIHC found US workers need to earn $22.10an hour to afford a “modest” two-bedroom rental. That’s about three times the federal minimum wage. “This year’s findings,” the report says, “demonstrate how far out of reach modestly priced housing is for the growing low-wage work force, despite recent wage growth, and for other vulnerable populations across the country.” Here’s a breakdown of the report. The hourly wage the NLIHC uses throughout the report is called a “housing wage.” The NLIHC based that figure on what the Department of Housing and Urban Development calls “fair market rent,” an estimation of how much a family would expect to pay in a given area. The NLIHC then used that number to determine how much a full-time worker has to earn without spending 30% of their income on housing. In Arkansas, where housing costs are lowest, workers still need to earn $13.84 an hour to afford a 2-bedroom home. The average fair market rent in Arkansas is $720 and the minimum wage is $8.50, the report notes. The average fair market rent in Hawaii is $1,879, the most expensive in all 50 states. Though the state recently raised itsminimum wage to $10.10, households still need to earn $36.13 per hour to afford that 2-bedroom home. Here are the top 10 most expensive states, including Washington, D.C. The disparity is starkest in major metropolitan areas. San Francisco tops the list for the cities with the most expensive housing wage.Workers there have to earn $60.02 an hour on average to live in a 2-bedroom rental. Of the 10 most expensive metropolitan counties, eight are in California, one is in New York and one is in Hawaii. Here are the most expensive metropolitan areas: A little, but not by much. On average, workers still need to earn $17.90 an hour to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment. In 22 out of 3,000 counties nationwide could workers earning minimum wage afford to rent a one-bedroom, the NLIHC says. According to the report, a worker earning minimum wage would have to work 99 hours per week all year long to afford a one-bedroom home. That’s about 2.5 full-time jobs. The report calls out President Donald Trump and his administration, which hasproposed cutting funding for federal housing assistance. Earlier this year, HUD Secretary Ben Carsonannounced a proposal to triple the rent for householdsreceiving federal housing assistance, and require they pay 35% of their gross income in rent, instead of the current requirement of 30%. Carson said the proposal would help address rising costs of providing housing assistance, which he said currently helps only one in four families who qualify. Trump’s proposed cuts for the 2019 fiscal year, the NLIHC report says, would “lead to the largest reduction in affordable housing and community development investments in decades,” taking “vital federal rental assistance” from 200,000 families. But rather than cutting assistance, the report says, the government should continue to invest in housing programs that help the lowest-income households. “The affordable housing crisis demands that we think big and act boldly,” writes Sen. Bernie Sanders in the report’s preface. “In the richest country in history,” he says, “no family should have to make the awful choice between food on the table and keeping a roof over their heads. This is America. We have the resources to solve the affordable housing crisis.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 South Court AuditoriumEisenhower Executive Office Building 9:40 A.M. EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good morning.  Good morning.  It is truly an honor to be with you today.  And thank you, Andrés Gluski, Susan Segal,Erin[Eric] Farnsworth, for your leadership.The membership of the Council of the Americas includes so many leaders who are truly committed to strengthening economies and democracies throughout the Western Hemisphere.  And I’m very pleased to join you today.Last week, President Joe Biden and I reached the 100th day of our administration.  In that time, we have let the world know — and the President has been very clear about this — America is back.We have rejoined the Paris Agreement.  We are ending our nation’s longest war.  We are rebuilding our alliances and engaging partners all over the world.  And we are revitalizing our relationships throughout the Western Hemisphere from the southernmost parts of South America, to the northernmost parts of Canada, and everywhere in between.The Western Hemisphere is our home.  And because it is our home, because the people within it are our neighbors, it is imperative that we promote democracy and good governance, security, and prosperity within the region.It is also important that we build relationships throughout the hemisphere that are based ondignicy[dignity] and diplomacy — relationships that are both candid and collaborative.The strength of the United States of America depends on the strength of all of the Western Hemisphere.  In so many ways, our fates are intertwined.  That is especially true of Latin America, one of our fastest-growing trade partners.To be sure, our relationship with Latin America is bigger than trade.  And our relationship is incredibly complex and, at times, has been incredibly complicated.  Today, I want to make clear that our administration firmly believes in the potential of the region and in the power of the people of the region.Latin Americans are shaping their own future.  They are writing their own story.  They hold the pen.  As I see it, our role is to read those words, take them in, and help however we can as Latin America writes its own next chapter.  Put another way: The United States is committed to supporting the vision of the people in the region in their need for relief, in their hope for opportunity, in their calls for justice.Eight years ago, President Joe Biden addressed this conference.  Then Vice President, he led our nation’s diplomatic efforts within the Northern Triangle and with Mexico.  Recently, he asked me to take the lead.  This is a priority for our nation and a role that I take very seriously.We are all well aware of the immediate situation.  The citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras are leaving their homes at alarming rates.  But there’s a fundamental truth behind that headline: People in the region do not want to leave their homes.  They do not want to leave the communities they have known their entire lives — the church they go to every Sunday, the park they take their children to, their friends, their family, their community.I do believe they leave only when they feel they must.  And I’m thinking about people whose homes have been washed away by hurricanes.  People who are parents who have sons who have been threatened by drug cartels.  People who have daughters who have been targeted by human traffickers.  People who do not have enough to eat.  People who are out of work.  People who have lost hope.And that’s why they leave home and come to the United States: They are suffering.  They are in pain.  Many are experiencing unimaginable anguish.So we want to help.  Our administration wants to help.  We want to pick back up the kind of work President Joe Biden started when he was Vice President.  We want to help people find hope at home.  And so we are focused on addressing both the acute factors and the root causes of migration.  I believe this is an important distinction.  We must focus on both.First, the acute factors — the catastrophes that are causing people to leave right now: the hurricanes, the pandemic, the drought, and extreme food insecurity.And then there are the longstanding issues — the root causes — and I’m thinking of corruption, violence, and poverty; the lack of economic opportunity; the lack of climate adaptation and climate resilience; the lack ofgood governance.Just this weekend, we learned that the Salvadoran Parliament moved to undermine its nation’s highest court. An independent judiciary is critical to a healthy democracyand a strong economy.On this front, on every front, we must respond.So there is much work that needs to be done to combat violence in the Northern Triangle — violence againstAfro-descendants, violence against Indigenous people, violence against LGBTQ people, violence against young people, violence against women.And I’ve spent much of my career defending survivors of sexual assault and domestic violence.  I have fought forthe equality and the safety of every group I just named.  And I believe, as I know all of you do, that we must stand up for thebasic human rights of all people.  And when those rights are violated, I will say it again, we must respond.In El Salvador, in the face of violence, we must focuson high-crime areas and give young people alternatives to gang recruitment.In Honduras, in the wake of hurricanes, we must deliver food, shelter, water, and sanitation to the people.And in Guatemala, as farmers endure continuous droughts,we must work with them to plant drought-resistant crops.  We must also help them and help women farmers increase their harvests.This work makes a difference.   However, no matter how much effort we put in — on curbing violence, on providing disaster relief, on tackling food insecurity, on any of it — we will not make significant progress if corruption in the region persists.If corruption persists, history has told us, it will beone step forward and two steps back.  And we know corruption causes government institutions to collapse from within, preventing people from getting their children educated, from getting a business started, from getting a fair trial.In the Northern Triangle, we also know that corruption prevents us from creating the conditions on the ground to best attract investment.  And around the world, we know that corruption inhibits shared prosperity.  In fact, the global cost of corruption is as much as 5 percent of the world’s GDP — 5 percent.The work from combatting corruption to combating climate change will not be easy, and it is not new, and it could not be more important.  And it will take all of us — all of us.  The United States cannot do it alone.  With all of us gathered here today, I’m very hopeful about what we can accomplish together.Our administration is implementing a comprehensive strategy with governments and international institutions, the private sector, foundations, and community organizations.  The idea here is that our work will be coordinated and that every sector will have a role to play.First: regional governments.  Governments in the region can take on corruption, lift their communities, and provide safety and security for their citizens.For instance, last week, I had a bli- — bilateral meeting with the Guatemalan President, and we agree to strengthen cooperation to shut down human traffickers and smugglers.  In just a few days, I will meet virtually with the President of Mexico.  And in a month from now, I will visit both countries.Second, there is a role for governments outside of the region and international institutions.  The United States Ambassador to the United Nations is working within the U.N. to support their humanitarian response plan.I’ve also spoken with world leaders from Canada, Finland, Ireland, Japan about partnering with us to help the Northern Triangle.And for our part, the United States has announced that we will send an additional $310 million to the region.  Departments and agencies across our federal government are joining in this effort.  The United States Department of Commerce is planning a virtual trade mission.  Our Agricultural Department is increasing food assistance.  USAID has deployed a Disaster Assistance Response Team.And as I told our Cabinet secretaries, we must be ambitious and deliberate.  We must also be proactive not just in the Northern Triangle, but across Latin America.Third, we must think beyond government.  I’ve spoken with foundation leaders who have been sending support to the region for a long time and are now prepared to do more.  I’ve also been engaging with a number of businesses in the United States and business leaders in the United States about their interest in investing in the region and the barriers that may stand in their way.  Private-sector investments can create jobs and speed up progress.Meanwhile, community organizations can help us implement a place-based approach targeting those communities that have been hardest hit.  Community organizations will also help us to restore hope.Last Tuesday, I had a virtual meeting with a group of longstanding community leaders in Guatemala.  They talked about the work they have been doing to feed people, to house people, to find people jobs all while taking on relentless corruption.  It is hard and difficult work that they do.  And they are 100 percent committed to it.  And they’ve committed their lives to it.  They are committed to building a better life for all of those people they serve.And when I met with those leaders, I was reminded not only of the region’s problems, but also of its potential — its potential to recover, its potential to rebuild, its potential to write its next chapter.It is in that spirit that the United States will continue this work, knowing that we are neighbors, knowing that our strength depends on one another and that our hope grows together.Thank you.  And may God bless you.  Thank you.9:53 A.M.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 The Capitol Madame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time. The First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests. My fellow Americans. While the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world. To declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities. Tonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America. As I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100thday of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis. The worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Now, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength. Life can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness. After 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America. 100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act. Together — we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results. After I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas. Today, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now. When I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot. At a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it’s like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief. Parents are seeing smiles on their kids’ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye It means everything to both of them. There’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen. What else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It’s making a difference. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world. A single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn’t work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn’t have the money. One of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you’d see that in America? That’s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already. We’re also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job. During these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We’re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year. In the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can’t stop now. We’re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21stCentury. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better. Throughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more. These are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That’s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It’s clean water. Today, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children’s health. The American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don’t have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21stCentury economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort. It creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms. The American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers. 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn’t get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits. For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs. The American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it. There’s no reason the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. The American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: “Buy American.” American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be. Now – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you. Independent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate’s degree. The American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I’ve always said. Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize. By the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It’s long past time. Finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we’re falling behind in that competition. Decades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy. The Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that’s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer. This is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our power Investments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let’s get to work. We welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn’t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21stCentury. To win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today. First, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting. 12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21stCentury. That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America. The research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Jill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she’ll be leading this effort. Second, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime. Third, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child. And fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6. With two parents, two kids, that’s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let’s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025. The American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up. In addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address –this year – other critical priorities for America’s families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health. And the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let’s lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are. In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that. Let’s do what we’ve always talked about. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won’t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone. The money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We’ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let’s get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans? I’ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do. I will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share. A recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That’s not right. We’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we’re going to reward work, not wealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans –those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That’s where it was when George W. Bush became president. We’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That’s estimated to be billions of dollars. Look, I’m not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough. What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible. It raises the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut? Look at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top. Instead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history. According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse. 20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion. My fellow Americans, trickle-down economics hasnever worked. It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out. A broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation. I’ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I’ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back –but for how long? My fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren’t going it alone – we’re going to be leading with our allies. No one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we’re experiencing now, pandemics. There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus away. As our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2. The climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It’s a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That’s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days. I wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world. The investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China. In my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property. I also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders – that America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms. No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle. With regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don’t seek escalation, their actions have consequences. I responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia’s interference in our elections and cyber—attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interests. As we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we’re working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America’s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence. And American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone. Today we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building. We went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake –the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond. And, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism. And my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, “Daddy changed the world.” After the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress. Most men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well. My fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats. We need to work together to find a consensus. Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act. We have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways. A chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American. I also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible. I also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back. And another thing. Let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. It’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives. And I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado. In the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. But in the early 2000’s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called “ghost guns.” They are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can’t be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren’t required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore. I will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it’s time for Congress to act as well. We need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before … and it worked. Talk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue. And here’s what else we can do. Immigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it. On day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it. We also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes. When I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down. I’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done. Now, if Congress won’t pass my plan – let’s at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home. And, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables. Immigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote. More people voted in the last presidential election than ever beforein our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked. Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act. As we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy  will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today. Can our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart? America’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people. In our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action. Our Constitution opens with the words, “We the People”. It’s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the people.” In another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America. I stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch. At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21stCentury. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America. It’s never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn’t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can’t do – if we do it together. May God bless you all. May God protect our troops. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

                "text_body": "The White House1600 Pennsylvania Ave NWWashington, DC 20500 While the American Rescue Plan is changing the course of the pandemic and delivering relief for working families, this is no time to build back to the way things were. This is the moment to reimagine and rebuild a new economy. The American Jobs Plan is an investment in America that will create millions of good jobs, rebuild our country’s infrastructure, and position the United States to out-compete China. Public domestic investment as a share of the economy has fallen by more than 40 percent since the 1960s. The American Jobs Plan will invest in America in a way we have not invested since we built the interstate highways and won the Space Race.The United States of America is the wealthiest country in the world, yet we rank 13thwhen it comes to the overall quality of our infrastructure. After decades of disinvestment, our roads, bridges, and water systems are crumbling. Our electric grid is vulnerable to catastrophic outages. Too many lack access to affordable, high-speed Internet and to quality housing. The past year has led to job losses and threatened economic security, eroding more than 30 years of progress in women’s labor force participation. It has unmasked the fragility of our caregiving infrastructure. And, our nation is falling behind its biggest competitors on research and development (R&D), manufacturing, and training. It has never been more important for us to invest in strengthening our infrastructure and competitiveness, and in creating the good-paying, union jobs of the future. Like great projects of the past, the President’s plan will unify and mobilize the country to meet the great challenges of our time: the climate crisis and the ambitions of an autocratic China. It will invest in Americans and deliver the jobs and opportunities they deserve. But unlike past major investments, the plan prioritizes addressing long-standing and persistent racial injustice. The plan targets 40 percent of the benefits of climate and clean infrastructure investments to disadvantaged communities. And, the plan invests in rural communities and communities impacted by the market-based transition to clean energy. Specifically, President Biden’s plan will:Fix highways, rebuild bridges, upgrade ports, airports and transit systems.The President’s plan will modernize 20,000 miles of highways, roads, and main-streets. It will fix the ten most economically significant bridges in the country in need of reconstruction. It also will repair the worst 10,000 smaller bridges, providing critical linkages to communities. And, it will replace thousands of buses and rail cars, repair hundreds of stations, renew airports, and expand transit and rail into new communities.Deliver clean drinking water, a renewed electric grid, and high-speed broadband to all Americans.President Biden’s plan will eliminate all lead pipes and service lines in our drinking water systems, improving the health of our country’s children and communities of color. It will put hundreds of thousands of people to work laying thousands of miles of transmission lines and capping hundreds of thousands of orphan oil and gas wells and abandoned mines. And, it will bring affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every American, including the more than 35 percent of rural Americans who lack access to broadband at minimally acceptable speeds.Build, preserve, and retrofit more than two million homes and commercial buildings, modernize our nation’s schools and child care facilities, and upgrade veterans’ hospitals and federal buildings.President Biden’s plan will create good jobs building, rehabilitating, and retrofitting affordable, accessible, energy efficient, and resilient housing, commercial buildings, schools, and child care facilities all over the country, while also vastly improving our nation’s federal facilities, especially those that serve veterans.Solidify the infrastructure of our care economy by creating jobs and raising wages and benefits for essential home care workers.These workers – the majority of whom are women of color – have been underpaid and undervalued for too long. The President’s plan makes substantial investments in the infrastructure of our care economy, starting by creating new and better jobs for caregiving workers. His plan will provide home and community-based care for individuals who otherwise would need to wait as many as five years to get the services they badly need.Revitalize manufacturing, secure U.S. supply chains, invest in R&D, and train Americans for the jobs of the future. President Biden’s plan will ensure that the best, diverse minds in America are put to work creating the innovations of the future while creating hundreds of thousands of quality jobs today. Our workers will build and make things in every part of America, and they will be trained for well-paying, middle-class jobs.Create good-quality jobs that pay prevailing wages in safe and healthy workplaces while ensuring workers have a free and fair choice to organize, join a union, and bargain collectively with their employers.By ensuring that American taxpayers’ dollars benefit working families and their communities, and not multinational corporations or foreign governments, the plan will require that goods and materials are made in America and shipped on U.S.-flag, U.S.-crewed vessels. The plan also will ensure that Americans who have endured systemic discrimination and exclusion for generations finally have a fair shot at obtaining good paying jobs and being part of a union.Alongside his American Jobs Plan, President Biden is releasing a Made in America Tax Plan to make sure corporations pay their fair share in taxes and encourage job creation at home. A recent study found that 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal taxes on U.S. income in 2018. Another study found that the average corporation paid just 8 percent in taxes. President Biden believes that profitable corporations should not be able to get away with paying little or no tax by shifting jobs and profits overseas. President Biden’s plan will reward investment at home, stop profit shifting, and ensure other nations won’t gain a competitive edge by becoming tax havens.The President’s American Jobs Plan is a historic public investment – consisting principally of one-time capital investments in our nation’s productivity and long-term growth. It will invest about 1 percent of GDP per year over eight years to upgrade our nation’s infrastructure, revitalize manufacturing, invest in basic research and science, shore up supply chains, and solidify our care infrastructure. These are investments that leading economists agree will give Americans good jobs now and will pay off for future generations by leaving the country more competitive and our communities stronger. In total, the plan will invest about $2 trillion this decade. If passed alongside President Biden’s Made in America corporate tax plan, it will be fully paid for within the next 15 years and reduce deficits in the years after.BUILD WORLD-CLASS TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE: FIX HIGHWAYS, REBUILD BRIDGES, AND UPGRADE PORTS, AIRPORTS AND TRANSIT SYSTEMSPresident Biden is calling on Congress to make a historic and overdue investment in our roads, bridges, rail, ports, airports, and transit systems. The President’s plan will ensure that these investments produce good-quality jobs with strong labor standards, prevailing wages, and a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively. These investments will advance racial equity by providing better jobs and better transportation options to underserved communities. These investments also will extend opportunities to small businesses to participate in the design, construction, and manufacturing of new infrastructure and component parts. President Biden’s plan will deliver infrastructure Americans can trust, because it will be resilient to floods, fires, storms, and other threats, and not fragile in the face of these increasing risks. President Biden is calling on Congress to:Transform our crumbling transportation infrastructure:Decades of declining public investment has left our roads, bridges, rail, and transit systems in poor condition, with a trillion-dollar backlog of needed repairs. More than 35,000 people die in traffic crashes on U.S. roads each year, and millions more are seriously and often permanently injured. The United States has one of the highest traffic fatality rates in the industrialized world, double the rate in Canada and quadruple that in Europe. Across cities, suburbs, and rural areas, President Biden’s plan will help parents get to work reliably and affordably, reduce the impacts of climate change for our kids, and make sure fewer families mourn the loss of a loved one to road crashes. His investments will use more sustainable and innovative materials, including cleaner steel and cement, and component parts Made in America and shipped on U.S.-flag vessels with American crews under U.S. laws. And, his infrastructure investments will mitigate socio-economic disparities, advance racial equity, and promote affordable access to opportunity.The President’s plan invests an additional $621 billion in transportation infrastructure and resilience. It will: Make our infrastructure more resilient:Millions of Americans feel the effects of climate change each year when their roads wash out, airport power goes down, or schools get flooded. Last year alone, the United States faced 22 extreme weather and climate-related disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each – a cumulative price tag of nearly $100 billion. Chronic underinvestment in resilience has harmed American transportation infrastructure, disrupting service, making travel conditions unsafe, causing severe damage, and increasing maintenance and operating costs.In 2020, the United States endured 22 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, costing $95 billion in damages to homes, businesses, and public infrastructure. In Louisiana, Hurricane Laura caused $19 billion of damage, resulting in broken water systems and a severely damaged electrical grid that impeded a quick recovery. Building back better requires that the investments in this historic plan make our infrastructure more resilient in the face of increasingly severe floods, wildfires, hurricanes, and other risks. Every dollar spent on rebuilding our infrastructure during the Biden administration will be used to prevent, reduce, and withstand the impacts of the climate crisis. Additionally, the President is calling for $50 billion in dedicated investments to improve infrastructure resilience and: REBUILD CLEAN DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTURE, A RENEWED ELECTRIC GRID, AND HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND TO ALL AMERICANSToo many American families drink polluted water, lack access to affordable, high-speed internet, or experience power outages too often – all while paying more for those services. President Biden’s plan invests in the infrastructure necessary to finally deliver the water, broadband, and electricity service that Americans deserve. Specifically, his plan will:Ensure clean, safe drinking water is a right in all communities:Across the country, pipes and treatment plants are aging and polluted drinking water is endangering public health. An estimated six to ten million homes still receive drinking water through lead pipes and service lines. The President’s investments in improving water infrastructure and replacing lead service lines will create good jobs, including union and prevailing wage jobs. President Biden’s plan invests $111 billion to: Revitalize America’s digital infrastructure:Generations ago, the federal government recognized that without affordable access to electricity, Americans couldn’t fully participate in modern society and the modern economy. With the 1936 Rural Electrification Act, the federal government made a historic investment in bringing electricity to nearly every home and farm in America, and millions of families and our economy reaped the benefits. Broadband internet is the new electricity. It is necessary for Americans to do their jobs, to participate equally in school learning, health care, and to stay connected. Yet, by one definition, more than 30 million Americans live in areas where there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. Americans in rural areas and on tribal lands particularly lack adequate access. And, in part because the United States has some of the highest broadband prices among OECD countries, millions of Americans can’t use broadband internet even if the infrastructure exists where they live. In urban areas as well, there is a stark digital divide: a much higher percentage of White families use home broadband internet than Black or Latino families. The last year made painfully clear the cost of these disparities, particularly for students who struggled to connect while learning remotely, compounding learning loss and social isolation for those students.The President believes we can bring affordable, reliable, high-speed broadband to every American through a historic investment of $100 billion. That investment will: Reenergize America’s power infrastructure:As the recent Texas power outages demonstrated, our aging electric grid needs urgent modernization. A Department of Energy study found that power outages cost the U.S. economy up to $70 billion annually. The President’s plan will create a more resilient grid, lower energy bills for middle class Americans, improve air quality and public health outcomes, and create good jobs, with a choice to join a union, on the path to achieving 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2035. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $100 billion to: BUILD, PRESERVE, AND RETROFIT MORE THAN TWO MILLION HOMES AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS; MODERNIZE OUR NATION’S SCHOOLS, COMMUNITY COLLEGES, AND EARLY LEARNING FACILITIES; AND UPGRADE VETERANS’ HOSPITALS AND FEDERAL BUILDINGSThere is a severe shortage of affordable housing options in America, and the American Society of Civil Engineers gives our school infrastructure a “D+.” President Biden believes we must invest in building and upgrading modern, resilient, and energy-efficient homes and buildings, including our nation’s schools, early learning facilities, veterans’ hospitals and other federal buildings, and in the process, employ American workers in jobs with good wages and benefits. President Biden’s plan will:Build, preserve, and retrofit more than two million homes and commercial buildings to address the affordable housing crisis:There is a severe shortage of affordable housing options in America. Millions of families pay more than half their income on rent, and home energy costs are a significant concern for American renters as well. And, across the country, people are struggling to purchase their first home.The President’s plan invests $213 billion to produce, preserve, and retrofit more than two million affordable and sustainable places to live. It pairs this investment with an innovative new approach to eliminate state and local exclusionary zoning laws, which drive up the cost of construction and keep families from moving to neighborhoods with more opportunities for them and their kids. The President’s plan will help address the growing cost of rent and create jobs that pay prevailing wages, including through project labor agreements with a free and fair choice to join a union and bargain collectively.President Biden is calling on Congress to: Modernize our nation’s schools and early learning facilities:Too many students attend schools and child care centers that are run-down, unsafe, and pose health risks. These conditions are dangerous for our kids and exist disproportionately in schools with a high percentage of low-income students and students of color. And even before COVID-19, 43 percent of parents reported struggling to find an adequate child care facility for their children. President Biden is calling on Congress to: Upgrade VA hospitals and federal buildings:The federal government operates office buildings, courthouses, and other facilities in every state, where millions of workers serve the public from outdated, inefficient, and sometimes unsafe working conditions. While the median age of U.S. private sector hospitals is roughly 11 years, the Veterans Affairs’ hospital portfolio has a median age of 58. The President believes our veterans deserve state-of-the-art hospitals and care. President Biden’s plan provides $18 billion for the modernization of Veterans Affairs hospitals and clinics. President Biden’s plan also invests $10 billion in the modernization, sustainability, and resilience of federal buildings, including through a bipartisan Federal Capital Revolving Fund to support investment in a major purchase, construction or renovation of Federal facilities. And, President Biden’s plan utilizes the vast tools of federal procurement to purchase low carbon materials for construction and clean power for these newly constructed VA hospitals and federal buildings.SOLIDIFY THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF OUR CARE ECONOMY BY CREATING JOBS AND RAISING WAGES AND BENEFITS FOR ESSENTIAL HOME CARE WORKERSEven before COVID-19, our country was in the midst of a caregiving crisis. In addition to caring for children, families feel the financial burden of caring for aging relatives and family members with disabilities, and there is a financial strain for people with disabilities living independently to ensure that they are getting care in their homes. At the same time, hundreds of thousands of people who need better care are unable to access it, even though they qualify under Medicaid. In fact, it can take years for these individuals to get the services they badly need. Aging relatives and people with disabilities deserve better. They deserve high-quality services and support that meet their unique needs and personal choices.Caregivers – who are disproportionally women of color – have been underpaid and undervalued for far too long. Wages for essential home care workers are approximately $12 per hour, putting them among the lowest paid workers in our economy. In fact, one in six workers in this sector live in poverty. President Biden is calling on Congress to make substantial investments in the infrastructure of care in our country. Specifically, he is calling on Congress to put $400 billion toward expanding access to quality, affordable home- or community-based care for aging relatives and people with disabilities. These investments will help hundreds of thousands of Americans finally obtain the long-term services and support they need, while creating new jobs and offering caregiving workers a long-overdue raise, stronger benefits, and an opportunity to organize or join a union and collectively bargain. Research shows thatincreasingthe pay of direct care workers greatly enhances workers’ financial security, improves productivity, and increases the quality of care offered. Anotherstudyshowed that increased pay for care workers prevented deaths, reduced the number of health violations, and lowered the cost of preventative care.President Biden’s plan will: INVEST IN R&D, REVITALIZE MANUFACTURING AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AND TRAIN AMERICANS FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTUREHalf the jobs in our high growth, high wage sectors are concentrated in just 41 counties, locking millions of Americans out of a shot at a middle-class job. President Biden believes that, even in the face of automation and globalization, America can and must retain well-paid union jobs and create more of them all across the country. U.S. manufacturing was the Arsenal of Democracy in World War II and must be part of the Arsenal of American Prosperity today, helping fuel an economic recovery for working families. From the invention of the semiconductor to the creation of the Internet, new engines of economic growth have emerged due to public investments that support research, commercialization, and strong supply chains. President Biden is calling on Congress to make smart investments in research and development, manufacturing and regional economic development, and in workforce development to give our workers and companies the tools and training they need to compete on the global stage. Specifically, President Biden is calling on Congress to: Invest in R&D and the technologies of the future:Public investments in R&D lay the foundation for the future breakthroughs that over time yield new businesses, new jobs, and more exports. However, we need more investment if we want to maintain our economic edge in today’s global economy. We are one of the few major economies whose public investments in research and development have declined as a percent of GDP in the past 25 years. Countries like China are investing aggressively in R&D, and China now ranks number two in the world in R&D expenditures. In addition, barriers to careers in high-innovation sectors remain significant. We must do more to improve access to the higher wage sectors of our economy. In order to win the 21stcentury economy, President Biden believes America must get back to investing in the researchers, laboratories, and universities across our nation. But this time, we must do so with a commitment to lifting up workers and regions who were left out of past investments. He is calling on Congress to make an $180 billion investment that will: Retool and revitalize American manufacturers and small businesses:The U.S. manufacturing sector accounts for 70 percent of business R&D expenditure, 30 percent of productivity growth, and 60 percent of exports. Manufacturing is a critical node that helps convert research and innovation into sustained economic growth. Workers on the factory floor work hand-in-hand with engineers and scientists to sharpen and maintain our competitive edge. While manufacturing jobs have been a ladder to middle-class life, we have let our industrial heartland be hollowed out, with quality jobs moving abroad or to regions with lower wages and fewer protections for workers. President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $300 billion in order to: Invest in Workforce Development:As more Americans rejoin the workforce or seek out new opportunities in a changing economy, there is a greater need for skills development opportunities for workers of all kind. In order to ensure workers have ready access to the skills they will need to succeed, and to improve racial and gender equity, President Biden is calling on Congress to invest $100 billion in proven workforce development programs targeted at underserved groups and getting our students on paths to careers before they graduate from high school. His plan will: CREATE GOOD-QUALITY JOBS THAT PAY PREVAILING WAGES IN SAFE AND HEALTHY WORKPLACES WHILE ENSURING WORKERS HAVE A FREE AND FAIR CHOICE TO ORGANIZE, JOIN A UNION, AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY WITH THEIR EMPLOYERSAs America works to recover from the devastating challenges of a deadly pandemic, an economic crisis, and a reckoning on race that reveals deep disparities, we need to summon a new wave of worker power to create an economy that works for everyone. We owe it not only to those who have put in a lifetime of work, but to the next generation of workers who have only known an America of rising inequality and shrinking opportunity. This is especially important for workers of color and for women, who have endured discrimination and systematic exclusion from economic opportunities for generations. All of us deserve to enjoy America’s promise in full — and our nation’s leaders have a responsibility to overcome racial, gender, and other inequalities to make it happen. To that end, the President is calling on Congress to create new, good-quality union jobs for American workers by leveraging their grit and ingenuity to address the climate crisis and build a sustainable infrastructure. Increased unionization canalsoimpactour economic growth overall by improving productivity. President Biden’s plan will: THE MADE IN AMERICA TAX PLANAlongside the American Jobs Plan, the President is proposing to fix the corporate tax code so that it incentivizes job creation and investment here in the United States, stops unfair and wasteful profit shifting to tax havens, and ensures that large corporations are paying their fair share.The 2017 tax law only made an unfair system worse. A recent independent study found that 91 Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in federal corporate taxes on U.S. income in 2018. In fact, according to recent analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the 2017 tax bill cut the average rate that corporations paid in half from 16 percent to less than 8 percent in 2018. A number of the provisions in the 2017 law also created new incentives to shift profits and jobs overseas. President Biden’s reform will reverse this damage and fundamentally reform the way the tax code treats the largest corporations. President Biden’s reform will also make the United States a leader again in the world and help bring an end to the race-to-the-bottom on corporate tax rates that allows countries to gain a competitive advantage by becoming tax havens. This is a generational opportunity to fundamentally shift how countries around the world tax corporations so that big corporations can’t escape or eliminate the taxes they owe by offshoring jobs and profits from the United States.Together these corporate tax changes will raise over $2 trillion over the next 15 years and more than pay for the mostly one-time investments in the American Jobs Plan and then reduce deficits on a permanent basis: These are key steps toward a fairer tax code that encourages investment in the United States, stops shifting of jobs and profits abroad, and makes sure that corporations pay their fair share. The President looks forward to working with Congress, and will be putting forward additional ideas in the coming weeks for reforming our tax code so that it rewards work and not wealth, and makes sure the highest income individuals pay their fair share. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

                "title": "Kamala Harris unveils plan to fine companies that don’t achieve pay equity | CNN Politics",
                "text_body": "Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on Monday unveiled her plan to close the wage gap by fining companies that fail to ensure they are paying men and women equally. The plan seeks to change where the onus falls in the current system: Instead of requiring employees to come forward to complain about equal pay, companies would now be required to submit data on equal pay each year to comply with new standards. In an interview with CNN on Sunday, shortly before Harris headlined a town hall in Los Angeles, the California Democrat called pay equity a “really big issue” where “if you lift up the economic status of women, you lift up the economic status of families and communities and all of society benefits.” “What I am proposing is we shift the burden: It should not be on that working woman to prove it, it should instead be on that large corporation to prove they’re paying people for equal work equally,” Harris said. “It’s that simple, it’s literally that simple. And this, then, is not only about fairness and equality, it’s about transparency. Show us what you got. That’s it.” According to thelatest Census Bureau data, the average woman working full time made roughly 80 cents for every dollar a man made in 2017. That gap was significantly wider for black and Hispanic women. The heart of Harris’ proposal is a requirement that corporations obtain an “Equal Pay Certification” to prove that they are not paying women less than men for the same kind of work. In order to receive that certification, the plan states that “companies must demonstrate they have eliminated pay disparities between women and men who are doing work of equal value” and, if gaps do exist, they must prove they are based on “merit, performance, or seniority – not gender.” “This will radically change the way we enforce equal pay in America,” reads the plan. “Our current equal pay laws rely exclusively on proving instances of individual discrimination and place the burden entirely on employees to hold big corporations accountable. … Under our plan, for the first time in American history, companies will be held responsible for demonstrating they are not engaging in pay discrimination.” Under the plan, companies with 100 or more employees will be required to obtain a certification from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission within three years of the plan’s passage by handing over employment data to the government. Companies with more than 500 employees will have two years to receive the certification. And each company will be required to display whether they met the certification on their company’s website. Those companies that do not receive the certification will be met with a stiff penalty: For every 1% gap in pay between men and women that persists after the EEOC accounts for experience and job titles, a Harris administration would fine companies 1% of their daily profits during that fiscal year. The Harris campaign estimates that the punishment for wage disparities would generate around $180 billion in 10 years, money that Harris’ campaign said would be invested in funding the FAMILY Act, a plan Harris backs to ensure paid family leave and medical leave. By taking on equal pay with her third major policy rollout of the campaign, Harris is jumping into a politically important debate that extends back to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 run, when the then-Democratic nominee regularly spoke about how her presidency would deliver “equal pay for equal work.” Harris said this proposal falls in line with her previous policy rollouts – including her tax relief for middle class families – because it “really is about lifting families up.” “The reality of it is that the economy of America is not working for working people, it’s just not,” Harris said. “This is a very big issue in our country and deserves all the resources and attention that anyone would expect when we are talking about whether or not people are paid for the work they do,” she added. “It’s a simple American value, as far as I’m concerned, pay people for the work they do.” Harris, as she has done of late on a series of issues, has said she would implement this plan as president with or without the help of Congress – an acknowledgment that even if Democrats win the presidency in 2020, they could easily not take control of the Senate. Harris’ plan states that, as president, she would use an executive action to force any company looking to bid on federal contracts of more than $500,000 to comply with the new standards and, for smaller contracts, companies will be given preferential treatment if they are in compliance with the equal pay standards. While an executive action allows Harris to implement the plan to some degree, it would significantly dampen the impact. Harris’ plan will almost certainly be met with condemnation from the business community, which will likely see the proposal as another government regulation with which it must comply. Harris said on Sunday that she is ready for the fight. “I’ve been in those fights before,” said the former attorney general of California. “I’ve been in the fights with the big banks around the foreclosure crisis that hit California and Nevada and a bunch of states around our country. I’ve been in those fights before.” © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

                "text_body": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Florida lawmakers have backtracked on legislative language that threatened to ban giving voters food or drink while near a polling place, removing the ban from an amended version of an elections bill that was approved by a House committee on Thursday. Theoriginal version of House bill 7041 forbade“giving or attempting to give any item” to a voter or “interacting or attempting to interact” with a voter within 150 feet of a polling place. But an amended version of the bill, approved by the state House Appropriations Committee,no longer includes either prohibition However, the bill's sponsor, Republican Rep. Blaise Ingoglia, argued that while the specific language is gone, it's possible that handing out food and water could run afoul of the bill's ban on \"engaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter.\" Ingoglia raised the example of a well-known politician, like Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, handing out food and water to voters without specifically asking for a voter's support. \"If Ron DeSantis started walking up and down the line, handing out stuff to voters in line within the 150 feet, I'd dare to say your nominee would say he was trying to influence the vote,\" he said. Voting rights advocates have criticized Republican-led, legislative efforts in states to add new restrictions to voting. And President Joe Biden Biden specifically pointed to Georgia's restrictions around handing out food and water to votersas part of his condemnation of those new laws. But Ingoglia said that while he felt \"Florida administered one of the smoothest\" elections in the country last year, that \"we should use every election that passes as an opportunity to look back and identify what we can do better.\" The 51-page Florida House bill makes sweeping changes to the state’s elections laws, including placing new restrictions on ballot drop boxes; changing the process for verifying voter signatures; requiring voters to apply to vote by mail more frequently; and banning officials from receiving private funds aimed at funding election expenses. Some Democrats who opposed the bill still applauded Ingoglia for making some changes supported by voting-rights activists, even as they raised other concerns about the amended legislation. The bill must pass through another committee vote before the state House gets a chance to approve it. The Republican state Senate is also working on its own overhaul of the state’s voting laws and a hearing on their bill was temporarily postponed this week.

                "text_body": " Featured Shows MSNBC TV More Follow msnbc More Brands More Shows Vice President Kamala Harris, 56, has never used her age as a guide for her life plans— not even when others told her “no.” “I’ve never been one to do a five-year plan. Never. I’ve never evaluated myself based on my age,” Harris recently told Know Your Value founder and “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski. “...I’ve been told many times during my career, things from, ‘oh, you're too young, ‘It's not your turn,’ ‘They're not ready for you.’ But I didn't listen.” The vice president added: “I eat ‘no’ for breakfast.” The interview aired Tuesday on “Morning Joe,” coinciding with the kick off of Forbes and Know Your Value’s “50 Over 50” list, which honors women who are defying age and gender norms. The list,released in full on Wednesday,includes Harris among its honorees. During the interview, Harris encouraged women not to view their age as a limitation and to follow their passions at every phase of their lives. “There is so much that we still need to do to encourage girls and women of every age to know and internalize their capacity, and to internalize their strength and their gift, whatever that may be—and to not be burdened by other peoples’ limited views of their capacity based on who has historically done what,” she said. In 2020, Harris became the first woman, the first African-American and the first South Asian to be elected Vice President of the United States. The daughter of Indian and Jamaican parents, Harris was also the first South Asian woman and the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate in 2017. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, was a renowned scientist and civil rights activist who inspired Harris to follow her dreams. At every turn, women are often discouraged from pursuing their passion, the Vice President contended. Many women don’t have access to affordable childcare or paid leave. Older women are often forced into early retirement, or they face hiring discrimination when they leave the workforce then try to return later on. The pandemic only compounded the inequality. According to theBureau of Labor Statistics,about 2.5 million women left the workforce during the pandemic. Women-owned businesses weredisproportionately affected. “There's a whole push for legislation and for people to support those women's right to be able to return to work,” said Harris. “...Women should not be penalized for a pandemic they did not create, and they should not be penalized for their age.” Harris encouraged communities to improve women’s economic standing by investing in community-oriented banks, for example, which would uplift women-owned businesses when large banks won’t support them. Further, she encouraged women to feel entitled to these rights in order to push for change. “Continue with your ambition and don’t apologize for it,” said Harris.” Continue to believe that you can do whatever you want to do, but also know you have the right to expect things like affordable childcare. You have the right to accept paid family leave when you need to take care of your children or elderly parents. Do not accept false choices that you have to choose either this thing or that thing. Don’t accept it.” About 12,000 women were nominated for the Forbes and Know Your Value “50 over 50” list, including Harris. “Harris has made history as the first woman and woman of color selected as vice president. But perhaps more importantly, she's utterly committed to making sure she’s not the last,”wrote Brzezinski. © 2024 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

                "text_body": " Profile Sections tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time In a matter of months, Republican lawmakers in nearly half of the states have proposed legislation to limit the teaching of concepts such as racial equity and white privilege. In some cases, those concepts have been inaccurately described as “critical race theory” — a decades-old academic premise that contends systemic racism remains central to much of American life and its legal system. While only a handful of these bills, introduced since at least February, explicitly mention critical race theory, they all contain similar language and goals, and deem teaching of historical racism and its impact on modern U.S. society divisive or racist. There is scant evidence, experts note, that critical race theory is being widely taught in K-12 public schools, as it’s usually introduced at the graduate school level. Critics accuse conservatives who are championing the legislation of using the term as a catchall for any anti-racist and diversity efforts in education — an effort they fear is meant to silence certain views. \"Any anti-racist effort is being labeled as critical race theory,” said Jonathan Chism, assistant professor of history at the University of Houston–Downtown and co-editor of\"Critical Race Studies Across Disciplines.” “Many that are condemning critical race theory haven’t read it or studied it intensely. This is largely predicated on fear: the fear of losing power and influence and privilege,” he said. “The larger issue that this is all stemming from is a desire to deny the truth about America, about racism.” In some states, lawmakers have also sought to put limits on teachers’ ability to make references to The New York Times’ Pulitzer Prize-winning1619 Project, which argues the introduction of slavery marks the nation’s true beginning. In the wake of the project’s release, Chicago Public Schools officials announced the school systemwould utilize the projectin classrooms. Schools in New York, New Jersey and Washington, D.C., followed suit, noting the importance of highlighting the way America’s past has influenced the present. So far, such legislation has been proposed in 22 states and signed into law in five — Idaho, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas and Tennessee. Legislators behind the Idaho bill said critical race theory “tries to make kids feel bad.” Tennessee lawmakers said teaching about racism promotes “division,” and a pending bill in Rhode Island bans teaching the idea that “the United States of America is fundamentally racist or sexist.” The fight over race and equity in schools is a coordinated one, backed by well-connected conservative groups and media outlets. An NBC news analysis found at least 165 local and national groups that aim to disrupt lessons on race and gender. The groups are largely reinforced by conservative think tanks, law firms and activist parents. The tension can be traced back to then-President Donald Trump’s 2020 memo in which the White House Office of Management and Budget ordered a stop to funding federal training on diversity and critical race theory. Around the same time, Trump sought torebukethe 1619 Project, which culminated with the release of his administration’s “1776 Report” just prior to his leaving office earlier this year. Those actions planted the seed for the recent education fight, and critics of the bills say the tension pressures schools boards and ultimately harms students most. It’s a battle that has invaded every level of government from Congress through local school boards,with conservative groupsbacking the efforts. “The thing that disturbs me the most about politicizing school boards is there is no mention of kids,” said Sonja McKenzie, a member of the board of directors of the National School Boards Action Center, which advocates for public education. “It’s not community centered, it’s centered on political thought and theory and things that don't connect to education.” Christopher Rufo, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, has been one of the leaders behind the movement to curtail any expansion in teaching or training related to racism. In March, he promised to make critical race theory “toxic” in the public imagination. “The goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think ‘critical race theory,’” hetweeted. “We have decodified the term and will recodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with Americans.” Char Adams is a reporter for NBC BLK.

                "title": "All California Public High School Students Will Soon Have to Take Ethnic Studies - The New York Times",
                "text_body": "Advertisement Supported by California Today The requirement, the first in the nation, was signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom this month. BySoumya Karlamangla The hundreds of new laws that Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed over the past several weeks include plenty of “firsts.” Californiahas become the first state toforce the garment industry to pay workers by the hour, instead of per item. The first toban the sale of gas-powered lawn mowers. The first totarget Amazon production quotas. The first to outlawremoving a condom without permission during sex. Of these landmark bills, perhaps the most controversial is one requiring all public high school students to take an ethnic studies course to graduate. Under the new law, high schoolers will be taught about the struggles and contributions of African Americans, Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans and other ethnic groups, “which have often been untold in U.S. history courses,” according to the state’s model ethnic studies curriculum. California’s student population is highly diverse — less than a quarter of public K-12 students are white. Through ethnic studies courses, students can learn their own stories as well as those of their classmates, Newsom said. “America is shaped by our shared history, much of it painful and etched with woeful injustice,” Newsom wrote inhis signing message. “Students deserve to see themselves in their studies, and they must understand our nation’s full history if we expect them to one day build a more just society.” Assembly Bill 101adds one semester of ethnic studies to the state’s high school graduation requirements. This will introduce high schoolers to concepts that have typically been reserved for the collegiate level. Not only wasethnic studies born on a Bay Area college campus, but it’s also already a graduation requisite at California community colleges, theCalifornia State University systemand someUniversity of California campuses. The specifics of what will be taught in high schools are up to local districts. The nearly900-page model curriculumapproved by the California Department of Education this year includes dozens of sample lessons, such as “#BlackLivesMatter and Social Change,” “Chinese Railroad Workers” and “U.S. Housing Inequality: Redlining and Racial Housing Covenants.” The first high schoolers subject to the new mandate are those graduating in the 2029-30 academic year. Schools don’t have to begin offering ethnic studies courses until 2025. The requirement applies to students at allCalifornia public schools, including charters. There are currently about 1.7 million public high school students in the state. Several districts inCaliforniahave already added ethnic studies to their high school graduation requirements, includingSan Diego,San Francisco,FresnoandLos AngelesUnified school districts. In 2017, Oregonpasseda law ordering that ethnic studies concepts be integrated into existing social studies courses for K-12 students. The rule differs from California’s in that it doesn’t create a distinct course focused on ethnic studies. California has been working for years on developing a model ethnic studies curriculum, butearly drafts faced heavy pushback from many quarters. Amid these concerns, Newsom last yearvetoed a nearly identical versionof the bill. Previous drafts of the state’s teaching guide were criticized as too left-leaning, filled with jargon and promoting “critical race theory,” an academic concept that argues racism is ingrained in American laws and government institutions. There was also condemnation from Jewish groups, who felt the curriculum emphasized Palestinian oppressionwhile barely mentioning the Holocaust, as well as other ethnic groups that felt excluded. The final version of the state’s curriculum,approved this March, deleted references that offended Jewish groups while adding lessons about the experiences of Jews, Arabs and Sikhs in America,The Los Angeles Times reports. It also struck terms such as “cisheteropatriarchy” and “hxrstory,” as well as language connecting capitalism with oppression. Yet critics remain. Some supporters of the original guidelines feel the scope should not have been expanded beyond the four ethnic groups that lived in America before Europeans arrived. Others find the current version too radical still. Williamson M. Evers, a former assistant secretary in the U.S. Department of Education, told The Los Angeles Times that the model curriculum was “permeated” with content that made it “racially divisive and burdened by faddish ideology.” As districts across the state figure out how to put into place this new mandate, the debate will undoubtedly continue.

Half Moon Bay, a coastal city south of San Francisco that has earned the title “The Pumpkin Capital,” has been hosting the competition for nearly half a century. Here’s some fun back story from the article: “Four-time Half Moon Bay Mayor Al Adreveno, 96, addressed the crowd to give a brief history of how the town cemented itself as the ‘pumpkin capital of the world.’ In the 1970s, Adreveno said he was introduced to the mayor of Circleville, Ohio, which also proclaimed itself the world pumpkin capital. The two cities challenged each other to a weigh-off, held in 1974 outside City Hall. Half Moon Bay won — by one pound, he said.” Thanks for reading. I’ll be back tomorrow. — Soumya P.S.

EDTTHE VICE PRESIDENT:  Good afternoon, everyone.  Good afternoon.  (Applause.)  Good afternoon.  Good af- — (applause) — (laughs) — to all of you, thank you.Have a seat.  Have a seat.Let me, first of all, thank Jennifer.  She and I and the Congresswoman Cherfilus-McCormick, Ben Crump, Tracie Davis, Representative Angie Nixon, Derrick Johnson from the NAACP, we’re — we had some time, before I came out, to talk with each other.  And I just want to say that there is extraordinary leadership, Jennifer, and everyone else, in this state.  And you are not alone.  (Applause.)  You are not alone.  You are not alone.I’ll tell you, yesterday, I was traveling to meet with some folks, when I heard the news about what happened here.  And our team and the President, you know, is completely on board with this.  We said we got to remind the folks of Florida that you’re not fighting out here by yourselves.  (Applause.)  We believe in you.  We believe in the people of Florida.And so, I decided to come and visit with you today.  (Laughs.)And — well, let me start by saying this.  I am a product of a public school education.  (Applause.)  I was sharing with some of the teachers earlier: My first-grade teacher, Mrs. Frances Wilson, God rest her soul, attended my law school graduation.AUDIENCE:  Aww —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  I am a product of teachers and an educational system that believed in providing the children with the full expanse of information that allowed them to then — and encouraged them — to then reach their own conclusions and exercise critical thought in a way that was directly intended to nurture their leadership.I am fully aware that it is because of that approach that I stand before you as Vice President of the United States of America.  (Applause.)So when I think about where we are today, and who we are as a community of people within the beauty of the diversity that I see in front of me, I know that there are many things we share in common.  And, first and foremost, we share in common a deep love of our country and the responsibility we each have, then, to fight for its ideals.  That is so critically important on the subject, then, that gathers us here today.Because, you see, when we think about it, part of true patriotism means fighting for a nation that will be better for each generation to come.  (Applause.)  Right?  Believing that our nation is worth the investment in fighting for the children of America, that we will provide them with the information they need to go into the world and lead.  (Applause.)I will tell you, as Vice President of the United States, I have now met with over 100 world leaders — presidents, prime ministers, chancellors, and kings.  One of the things about who we are as Americans is we can walk in those rooms with the authority earned, for the most part — except recently, sometimes — (laughs) — earned authority to walk in those rooms talking about what it means to uphold democracies, the importance of rule of law, human rights.And when we walk in those rooms, we do it proud of the fact that we have been held up and held out as a role model. Well, the thing about being a role model is this: When you’re a role model, people watch what you do to see if it matches what you say.  (Applause.) So, understand the impact that this is happeni- — having not only for the children of Florida and our nation, but potentially people around the world.  Because, on a more specific point, in that regard, we want to know that we are sending our children out as role models of a democracy, who, therefore, know the importance of speaking and telling truth, the importance of understanding when you are a leader, you must know history.  (Applause.)And, by the way, be really clear — be really clear: All the folks that we would go out and send our children to go and meet around the world are clear about our history, and we’re going to send our own children out to not know what it is?  Building in a handicap for our children, that they are going to be the ones in the room who don’t know their own history when the rest of the world does? Think about this for a moment — the levels of proportion. So when I think about where we are, I do believe that our strength as a nation has always been because we are continuously and always invested in fighting to reach our ideals.And let’s remember the preamble to the Constitution of the United States.  Ben Crump.MR. CRUMP:  Yes, ma’am.  (Laughter.)THE VICE PRESIDENT:  “We the People…in order to form a more perfect union” is part of the spirit behind our founding as a democracy.  Implicit in those words is we understood we must strive to form a more perfect union.  Implicit in those words was an understanding we are imperfect.  And we must be honest about that to understand, then, our history, where we’ve been, and then have a North Star in terms of where we must go.  (Applause.) So when I think about what is happening, then, here in Florida, I am deeply concerned.  Because let’s be clear: I do believe this is not only about the state of Florida; there is a national agenda afoot.  (Applause.)  And what is happening here in Florida?  Extremist so-called leaders for months have dared to ban books.  Book bans in this year of our Lord 2023. Extremists here in Florida passed a law, “Don’t Say Gay,” trying to instill fear in our teachers that they should not live their full life and love who they love. (Applause.)And now, on top of all of that, they want to replace history with lies.  Middle school students in Florida to be told that enslaved people benefited from slavery.AUDIENCE:  Booo —THE VICE PRESIDENT:  High schoolers may be taught that victims of violence, of massacres were also perpetrators.I said it yesterday: They insult us in an attempt to gaslight us — (applause) — and we will not have it.  And we will not have it.And, you know, as parents, we teach our children to tell the truth.  It’s one of the first things we teach our children: love and honor their parents, their God, and tell the truth.  We teach our children not only to tell the truth, but to seek knowledge and truth.It’s part of what we know is about putting them on the road for them to grow and develop for the sake of our mutual well-being and prosperity.  These are the things we tell them.Well, I think we should model what we say.  (Applause.) These extremist so-called leaders should model what we know to be the correct and right approach, if we really are invested in the well-being of our children.  Instead, they dare to push propaganda to our children.This is the United States of America.  We’re not supposed to do that.  (Applause.)And here’s the other piece about this.  Now, when adults know what slavery really involved — come on — adults know what slavery really involved.  It involved rape.  It involved torture.  It involved taking a baby from their mother.  It involved some of the worst examples of — of — of depriving people of humanity in our world.  It involved subjecting to people the requirement that they would think of themselves and be thought of as less than human.So, in the context of that, how is it that anyone could suggest that in the midst of these atrocities, that there was any benefit to being subjected to this level of dehumanization?  (Applause.)  In the midst of these atrocities, that there was some benefit?  (Applause.)So, it is not only misleading; it is false.  And it is pushing propaganda.  People who walk around and want to be praised as leaders, who want to be talked about as American leaders, pushing propaganda on our children.  Pushing propaganda on our children.And when we think about it, you know, when we send our children to school, as parents, we want to know that they are be taugh- — they are being taught the truth.  It is a reasonable expectation.  It is a reasonable expectation that our children will not be misled.  And that’s what’s so outrageous about what is happening right now: an abject and purposeful and intentional policy to mislead our children.And so, let us be clear: Teachers want to teach the truth.  (Applause.)  Teachers want to teach facts.  And teachers dedicate themselves to some of the most noble work any human being could take on: to teach other people’s children — (applause) — for the sake of the future of our nation.And so, they should not then be told by politicians that they should be teaching revisit- — revisionist history in order to keep their jobs.What is going on?  (Applause.)Our teachers who fear that if they teach the truth, they may lose their job.  As it is, we don’t pay them enough.  (Applause.)  You know!  I know.And these are the people — these extremist, so-called leaders — who all the while are also the ones suggesting that teachers strap on a gun in the classroom instead of what real leaders should be doing and be engaged in reasonable gun safety laws.  (Applause.)These are the same extremist leaders — so-called leaders — who make teachers fear losing their job for having a photograph of their spouse on their desk.  (Applause.)But let’s be clear: On this issue, as it — with — this is not the first time in history that we’ve come across this kind of approach.  This is not the first time that there are powerful forces that have attempted to distort history for the sake of political ends.Think about in the past how we have seen attempts to minimize and even deny the Holocaust.  (Applause.)  Think about those who tried to rewrite the history of the Japanese internment camps, erase our nation’s dark and sordid history in how we have treated the Native people and, in particular, through educational systems.  (Applause.)  Those who have tried — and there are states where they have — to ban teaching Latino and Hispanic history.This is not the first time.But when we think about it then in the context in which we should — understanding there is a national agenda afoot, understanding that there are many aspects of our history that some would like to overlook, erase, or at least deny — let us think about then what this creates as a moment for us to also then rededicate ourselves to the coalition.  (Applause.)  Our responsibility at moments like this to understand nobody should be made to fight alone.  We are all in this together.  (Applause.)And take a look — because, you know, there are a lot of teachers here, I think.  So I’m going to tell — you know, one of the things I love is Venn diagrams.  Any math teachers in the room?  I love Venn diagrams.  And I have — I have done an exercise of — of looking to see from where are we seeing the attacks on things like voting rights, LGBTQ rights, a woman’s right to make decisions about her own body, book bans.  And you will not be surprised to know a lot of them revert to the same source.So, let’s think about this then as an opportunity to build back up the coalition of all people who believe in our foundational and fundamental truths — the truth that we are and will be a more perfect union when we fight for justice — (applause) — when we fight for equality, when we fight for fairness, guided by a belief in who we are as a nation and telling our truths. And I will — I’ll close with this.  History has shown us that, in our darkest moments, we have the ability to unite — (applause) — and to come out stronger.  We knowE Pluribus Unum, “Out of many, one.” That is who we are in this room.  Out of many, one. Americans who came here through Ellis Island.  Americans who were kidnapped and brought over on slave ships.  Americans who are native to this land. Our history as a nation is born out of tragedy and triumph.  That’s who we are.  Part of that is what gives us our grit — knowing from where we came, knowing the struggles that we have come through, and being stronger in our dedication to saying, “No more” and “Not again.”  (Applause.) It is part of what makes up the character of who we are as America.  So let’s reject the notion that we would deny all of this, in terms of our history. Let us not be seduced into believing that somehow we will be better if we forget.  We will be better if we remember.  (Applause.)  We will be stronger if we remember. We fought a war to end the sin of slavery.  A civil war.  People died by the untold numbers in that war, many of whom fought and died because of their belief that slavery was a sin against man — (applause) — that it was inhumane, that it was not reflective of who we believe ourselves to be as a country, and certainly not reflective of who we aspire to be. So who then would dare deny this history?  Who would dare then deny that these lives were lost and why they were lost and what was the cause that they were fighting for and what were they fighting against? They weren’t fighting and dying because they thought people were — were going to be okay with this thing.  (Applause.)  It’s because they knew that it had to end because it was so, so criminal. So, we know the history, and let us not let these politicians, who are trying to divide our country, win. Because, you see, what they are doing — what they are doing is they are creating these unnecessary debates.  This is unnecessary to debate whether enslaved people benefited from slavery.  Are you kidding me?  (Applause.)  Are we supposed to debate that? Let us not be distracted by what they’re trying to do, which is to create unnecessary debates to divide our country.  Let’s not fall in that trap. We will stand united as a country.  We know our collective history; it is our shared history.  We are all in this together.  (Applause.) We know that we rise or fall together as a nation.  And we will not allow them to suggest anything other than what we know: The vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And so, let us stand always for what we know is right.  Let us fight for what is right.  And when we fight, we win.  (Applause.) God bless you.  And God bless the United States of America.Thank you.  (Applause.) END                  4:27 P.M.

The book, titled \"Mexican American Heritage,\" was considered by theTexas State Board of Educationfor Mexican-American studies classes that the state recently allowed as elective courses. The board rejected the textbook 14-0 on Wednesday in Austin, Texas. Since its submission, the book had been blasted for passages that painted Mexican Americans as undocumented immigrants and claimed that illegal immigration has \"caused a number of economic and security problems in the United States,\" including \"poverty, non-assimilation, drugs, crime, and exploitation.\" The book also said Mexican laborers \"were not reared to put in a full day's work so vigorously\" and that they had a culture of \"mañana.\" Related:Texas Textbook 'Dripping With Racism' Opposed at Hearing, Awaits Vote Tony Díaz, a Houston-based educator, community activist and author who spearheaded theLibrotraficantemovement, said in an interview with NBC Latino that the preliminary vote typically projects the official vote, which is scheduled for Friday. “Today is a very good day. We are very pleased with the results,\" Díaz said. “The unanimous vote by the board today is an amazing victory for everyone who showed how inaccurate the book was,” University of Texas at Austin professor Emilio Zamora told the Texas Tribune. He was on a committee that submitted a list of more than 140 corrections to the textbook, the Tribune reported. The vote came after a hearing Wednesday that allowed members of the public to voice their concerns. Díaz said people came in from other parts of the state to participate. \"We are making history because we filled a bus with 50 people and drove from Houston to push for more culturally relevant books in our classrooms statewide,\" Díaz said before the hearing.

                "title": "Supreme Court Upholds Order to Reduce Calif. Prison Population - The New York Times",
                "text_body": "Advertisement Supported by ByAdam Liptak WASHINGTON — Conditions in California’s overcrowded prisons are so bad that they violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment, the Supreme Courtruledon Monday, ordering the state to reduce its prison population by more than 30,000 inmates. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority in a 5-to-4 decision that broke along ideological lines, described a prison system that failed to deliver minimal care to prisoners with serious medical and mental health problems and produced “needless suffering and death.” Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A. Alito Jr. filed vigorous dissents. Justice Scalia called the order affirmed by the majority “perhaps the most radical injunction issued by a court in our nation’s history.” Justice Alito said “the majority is gambling with the safety of the people of California.” The majority opinion includedphotographsof inmates crowded into open gymnasium-style rooms and what Justice Kennedy described as “telephone-booth-sized cages without toilets” used to house suicidal inmates. Suicide rates in the state’s prisons, Justice Kennedy wrote, have been 80 percent higher than the average for inmates nationwide. A lower court in the case said it was “an uncontested fact” that “an inmate in one of California’s prisons needlessly dies every six or seven days due to constitutional deficiencies.” Monday’s ruling in the case, Brown v. Plata, No. 09-1233, affirmed an order by a special three-judge federal court requiring state officials to reduce the prison population to 110,000, which is 137.5 percent of the system’s capacity. There have been more than 160,000 inmates in the system in recent years, and there are now more than 140,000. Prison release orders are rare and hard to obtain, and even advocates for prisoners’ rights said Monday’s decision was unlikely to have a significant impact around the nation. “California is an extreme case by any measure,” said David C. Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project, which submitted abriefurging the justices to uphold the lower court’s order. “This case involves ongoing, undisputed and lethal constitutional violations. We’re not going to see a lot of copycat litigation.” State officials in California will have two years to comply with the order, and they may ask for more time. Justice Kennedy emphasized that the reduction in population need not be achieved solely by releasing prisoners early. Among the other possibilities, he said, are new construction, transfers out of state and using county facilities. At the same time, Justice Kennedy, citing the lower court decision, said there was “no realistic possibility that California would be able to build itself out of this crisis,” in light of the state’s financial problems. The court’s more liberal members — Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan — joined Justice Kennedy’s opinion. The special court’sdecision, issued in 2009, addressed two consolidated class-action suits, one filed in 1990, the other in 2001. In 2006, Arnold Schwarzenegger, then governor, said conditions in the state’s prisons amounted to a state of emergency. The majority seemed persuaded that the passage of time required the courts to act. Justice Scalia summarized his dissent, which was pungent and combative, from the bench. Oral dissents are rare; this was the second of the term. Justice Kennedy looked straight ahead as his colleague spoke, his face frozen in a grim expression. The decision was the fourth 5-to-4 decision of the term so far. All four of them have found the court’s more liberal members on one side and its more conservative members on the other, with Justice Kennedy’s swing vote the conclusive one. In the first three cases, Justice Kennedy sided with the conservatives. On Monday, he went the other way. This was in some ways unsurprising: in his opinions and in speeches, Justice Kennedy has long been critical of what he views as excessively long and harsh sentences. “A prison that deprives prisoners of basic sustenance, including adequate medical care, is incompatible with the concept of human dignity and has no place in civilized society,” Justice Kennedy wrote on Monday. In his dissent, Justice Scalia wrote that the majority opinion was an example of the problem of courts’ overstepping their constitutional authority and institutional expertise in issuing “structural injunctions” in “institutional-reform litigation” rather than addressing legal violations one by one. He added that the prisoners receiving inadequate care were not necessarily the ones who would be released early. “Most of them will not be prisoners with medical conditions or severe mental illness,” Justice Scalia wrote, “and many will undoubtedly be fine physical specimens who have developed intimidating muscles pumping iron in the prison gym.” In his statement from the bench, Justice Scalia said that the prisoners to be released “are just 46,000 happy-go-lucky felons fortunate enough to be selected.” (The justices used varying numbers in describing the number of affected prisoners. California’s prison population has been declining.) Justice Kennedy concluded his majority opinion by saying that the lower court should be flexible in considering how to carry out its order. Justice Scalia called this concluding part of the majority opinion “a bizarre coda” setting forth “a deliberately ambiguous set of suggestions on how to modify the injunction.” “Perhaps,” he went on, “the coda is nothing more than a ceremonial washing of the hands — making it clear for all to see, that if the terrible things sure to happen as a consequence of this outrageous order do happen, they will be none of this court’s responsibility. After all, did we not want, and indeed even suggest, something better?” Justice Clarence Thomas joined Justice Scalia’s dissent. In a second dissent, Justice Alito, joined by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., addressed what he said would be the inevitable impact of the majority decision on public safety in California. He summarized the decision this way, adding italics for emphasis: “The three-judge court ordered the premature release of approximately46,000 criminals — the equivalent of three Army divisions.” Justice Alito acknowledged that “particular prisoners received shockingly deficient medical care.” But, he added, “such anecdotal evidence cannot be given undue weight” in light of the sheer size of California’s prison system, which was at its height “larger than that of many medium-sized cities” like Bridgeport, Conn.; Eugene, Ore.; and Savannah, Ga. “I fear that today’s decision, like prior prisoner-release orders, will lead to a grim roster of victims,” Justice Alito wrote. “I hope that I am wrong. In a few years, we will see.” A picture caption in some copies on Tuesday with the continuation of an article about the Supreme Court ruling that conditions in California’s overcrowded prisons violate the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment misidentified a justice of the court. It was Antonin Scalia, not Samuel A. Alito Jr. When we learn of a mistake, we acknowledge it with a correction.
