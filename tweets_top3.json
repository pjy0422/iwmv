            "Justification": "Authorities arrested 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh on Sept. 15, whom they said pointed a gun through the fence at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, where former President Donald Trump was golfing. The FBI said it is investigating the event as \"what appears to be an assassination attempt\" against Trump. The investigation is ongoing, but neither the FBI nor local authorities have said it was staged. Authorities recovered evidence, including an AK-47-style rifle, from a spot along the fence surrounding Trump’s golf course. The suspect has been arrested and charged with two federal gun crimes.",

The Minnesota flag has an eight-pointed star, while Somalia’s star is five-pointed. The dark blue surrounding the star on the Minnesota flag represents the state’s shape and the light blue on the right represents the state’s abundant lakes and rivers.",

The U.S. warned Russia about the terror attack as part of a long-standing policy to alert other nations — even adversaries — about credible threats. The advance warning is not evidence that the U.S. perpetrated the attack. No spin, just facts you can trust.Here's how we do it.",

The claim that Woodall printed 64,000 ballots and had employees fill them out to favor Joe Biden originated with a Wisconsin man who has filed numerous lawsuits against Wisconsin officials, none of which have produced evidence of this claim. Milwaukee ballots are printed by city vendors, and the city does not have the capability to print 64,000 ballots, the mayoral spokesperson said.",
