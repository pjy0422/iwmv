But the three liberals dissented with a warning about how elevating a president will affect American democracy.\n\nThe decision has the near-term result of delaying Trump’s trial while a court in Washington, DC, considers which criminal activity that Trump is accused of can be considered “unofficial.” It also has the long-term effect of placing presidents in a different system of justice than other Americans.\n\nHere are key lines from a landmark ruling:\n\nWhat is this new immunity?\n\nChief Justice John Roberts explains it in the majority opinion as including absolute immunity for some actions and a presumption of immunity for others.\n\nWe conclude that under our constitutional structure of separated powers, the nature of Presidential power requires that a former President have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure in office. At least with respect to the President’s exercise of his core constitutional powers, this immunity must be absolute. As for his remaining official actions, he is also entitled to immunity. At the current stage of proceedings in this case, however, we need not and do not decide whether that immunity must be absolute, or instead whether a presumptive immunity is sufficient.\n\nWhy does a president need this immunity?\n\nSo that he can act boldly as president and take actions without fear of later prosecution clouding his judgement, according to the court. Here’s Roberts:\n\nPotential criminal liability, and the peculiar public opprobrium that attaches to criminal proceedings, are plainly more likely to distort Presidential decisionmaking than the potential payment of civil damages.\n\nThe hesitation to execute the duties of his office fearlessly and fairly that might result when a President is making decisions under “a pall of potential prosecution,” … raises “unique risks to the effective functioning of government.”\n\nWhat does it say in the Constitution about presidents getting special immunity?\n\nNothing. But that’s no problem, according to Roberts.\n\nTrue, there is no “Presidential immunity clause” in the Constitution. But there is no “‘separation of powers clause’” either. … Yet that doctrine is undoubtedly carved into the Constitution’s text by its three articles separating powers and vesting the Executive power solely in the President.\n\nHow far does this immunity extend?\n\nA president gets “at least a presumptive immunity” even for acts “within the outer perimeter of his official responsibility,” according to the court. But it’s careful to add that he gets no immunity for “unofficial acts” – and despite the broad reach of the immunity, the court argues presidents are still accountable.\n\nThe President enjoys no immunity for his unofficial acts, and not everything the President does is official. The President is not above the law. But Congress may not criminalize the President’s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution.\n\nAre any of the things Trump is accused of in special counsel Jack Smith’s indictment outside this blanket of immunity?\n\nDuring oral arguments in the case back in April, Trump’s attorney, John Sauer, told Justice Amy Coney Barrett that multiple elements of the indictment would indeed be “private,” or unofficial, acts. These include, for instance, getting an outside attorney to organize slates of false electors.\n\nBarrett, in a concurring opinion on Monday, said she would make clear in the decision what was official versus unofficial. But the majority takes no position and wants the trial court to go through the allegations individually. Trump can then appeal whatever the trial court decides. Here’s Roberts:\n\n… the current stage of the proceedings in this case does not require us to decide whether this immunity is presumptive or absolute. … Because we need not decide that question today, we do not decide it.\n\nDoes the majority tell the trial court what might be official or not?\n\nThe majority gives quite a bit of detail.\n\nTrump has “absolute immunity” for any instructions or pressure he exerted on his acting attorney general, for instance. Plus, the court won’t allow as evidence any interviews with people who worked in the administration (nullifying much of the evidence gathered by the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, events). And it also won’t let a court consider a president’s motives for taking an action.\n\nSuch an inquiry would risk exposing even the most obvious instances of official conduct to judicial examination on the mere allegation of improper purpose, thereby intruding on the Article II interests that immunity seeks to protect.\n\nIt’s an open question for the lower court to decide if Trump’s pressure on then-Vice President Mike Pence to disregard the 2020 election results involved “official conduct,” but the Supreme Court put that pressure in the “presumptively immune” category.\n\nWe accordingly remand to the District Court to determine in the first instance—with the benefit of briefing we lack—whether Trump’s conduct in this area qualifies as official or unofficial.\n\nThe majority thinks Trump’s tweets encouraging people to go to the Capitol and pressure Pence are within the “outer perimeter of his official responsibilities,” but they’re not sure and they expect it will be challenging for the lower court to muddle through these questions.\n\nWhy can’t a jury make these decisions?\n\nJuries can’t even consider official acts in terms of a prosecution, according to the Supreme Court.\n\nAllowing prosecutors to ask or suggest that the jury probe official acts for which the President is immune would thus raise a unique risk that the jurors’ deliberations will be prejudiced by their views of the President’s policies and performance while in office. The prosaic tools on which the Government would have courts rely are an inadequate safeguard against the peculiar constitutional concerns implicated in the prosecution of a former President.\n\nSo the Supreme Court gave Trump everything he wanted?\n\nIt certainly embraced Trump’s theory of immunity and pretty much guaranteed the trial will not happen before the election, although the majority says they were restrained since they rejected his request to completely dismiss the case.\n\nTrump asserts a far broader immunity than the limited one we have recognized. He contends that the indictment must be dismissed because the Impeachment Judgment Clause requires that impeachment and Senate conviction precede a President’s criminal prosecution.\n\nSo there is a special system of justice for presidents?\n\nThe president is more than a person, according to Roberts.\n\nLike everyone else, the President is subject to prosecution in his unofficial capacity. But unlike anyone else, the President is a branch of government, and the Constitution vests in him sweeping powers and duties. Accounting for that reality—and ensuring that the President may exercise those powers forcefully, as the Framers anticipated he would—does not place him above the law; it preserves the basic structure of the Constitution from which that law derives.\n\nThe majority dismisses warnings about a president operating above the laws as “fear mongering on the basis of extreme hypotheticals.” It’s more important to protect the president from political prosecutions, the court says.\n\nThe dissents overlook the more likely prospect of an Executive Branch that cannibalizes itself, with each successive President free to prosecute his predecessors, yet unable to boldly and fearlessly carry out his duties for fear that he may be next. … The enfeebling of the Presidency and our Government that would result from such a cycle of factional strife is exactly what the Framers intended to avoid.\n\nRoberts borrows from Trump’s attorneys when he quotes George Washington’s farewell address, in which he warns about factions. The problem with that particular quote, as I found earlier this year, is that Washington also warned about elevating a person above the law.\n\nDoes the court mention the politics of today?\n\nRoberts says the court’s considerations are more far-reaching than what’s happening at the moment.\n\nThis case poses a question of lasting significance: When may a former President be prosecuted for official acts taken during his Presidency? Our Nation has never before needed an answer. But in addressing that question today, unlike the political branches and the public at large, we cannot afford to fixate exclusively, or even primarily, on present exigencies. In a case like this one, focusing on “transient results” may have profound consequences for the separation of powers and for the future of our Republic.\n\nDid it say anything about Smith?\n\nThe majority did not weigh in on the brewing argument among conservatives that Smith should not even have a job and that his role as a special counsel is unconstitutional. But Justice Clarence Thomas endorsed the idea in a concurring opinion.\n\nIn this case, there has been much discussion about ensuring that a President “is not above the law.” But, as the Court explains, the President’s immunity from prosecution for his official acts is the law. … In that same vein, the Constitution also secures liberty by separating the powers to create and fill offices. And, there are serious questions whether the Attorney General has violated that structure by creating an office of the Special Counsel that has not been established by law.\n\nWhat did Barrett say about alternate electors?\n\nBarrett, a Trump appointee, wrote her own concurrence in which she disagreed with the majority on some key points. She said they could easily have expressed that some of Trump’s conduct was unofficial.\n\nSorting private from official conduct sometimes will be difficult—but not always. Take the President’s alleged attempt to organize alternative slates of electors. … In my view, that conduct is private and therefore not entitled to protection. … a President has no legal authority—and thus no official capacity—to influence how the States appoint their electors. I see no plausible argument for barring prosecution of that alleged conduct.\n\nWhat was in the blistering dissent?\n\nWriting for the three liberals on the court, Justice Sonia Sotomayor blasted the majority as inventing an “atextual, ahistorical, and unjustifiable immunity that puts the President above the law.” She said the court makes it difficult to imagine what might be “unofficial” conduct on the part of the president.\n\nIn sum, the majority today endorses an expansive vision of Presidential immunity that was never recognized by the Founders, any sitting President, the Executive Branch, or even President Trump’s lawyers, until now. Settled understandings of the Constitution are of little use to the majority in this case, and so it ignores them. … In fact, the majority’s dividing line between “official” and “unofficial” conduct narrows the conduct considered “unofficial” almost to a nullity.\n\nThe majority “pays lip service” to the idea that presidents are not above the law “but it then proceeds to place former Presidents beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws for any abuse of official power.”\n\nHow far does Sotomayor say presidents can now go?\n\nAs far as they want, she says.\n\nThe President of the United States is the most powerful person in the country, and possibly the world. When he uses his official powers in any way, under the majority’s reasoning, he now will be insulated from criminal prosecution. Orders the Navy’s Seal Team 6 to assassinate a political rival? Immune. Organizes a military coup to hold onto power? Immune. Takes a bribe in exchange for a pardon? Immune. Immune, immune, immune.\n\n… Even if these nightmare scenarios never play out, and I pray they never do, the damage has been done. The relationship between the President and the people he serves has shifted irrevocably. In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law.\n\nSotomayor ends her missive like this:"

      "text": "US election 2024: A really simple guide to the presidential vote\n\nBBC\n\nAmericans will head to the polls in November to elect the next US president. The vote will be closely watched around the world. They will also be voting for members of Congress, who play a key part in passing laws that can have a profound effect on American life.\n\nWhen is the next US presidential election?\n\nThe 2024 election will be on Tuesday, 5 November 2024. The winner will serve a term of four years in the White House, starting in January 2025. The president has the power to pass some laws on their own but mostly they must work with Congress to pass legislation. On the world stage, the US leader has considerable freedom to represent the country abroad and to conduct foreign policy.\n\nWho are the candidates and how are they nominated?\n\nThe two main parties nominate a presidential candidate by holding a series of votes called state primaries and caucuses, where people choose who they want to lead the party in a general election. In the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump won his party's support with a massive lead over his rivals. He became the official Republican nominee at a party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. For the Democrats, Vice-President Kamala Harris is closing in on the nomination. She joined the race after President Joe Biden dropped out. Ms Harris appears to have unassailable support within her party and could be crowned at its convention in August, in Chicago. There are also some independent candidates running for president, including Robert F Kennedy Jr, nephew to former president John F Kennedy.\n\nWhat do the Democrats and Republicans stand for?\n\nThe Democrats are the liberal political party, with an agenda defined largely by its push for civil rights, a broad social safety net and measures to address climate change. The Republicans are the conservative political party in the US. Also known as the GOP, or the Grand Old Party, it has stood for lower taxes, shrinking the size of the government, gun rights and tighter restrictions on immigration and abortion.\n\nHow does the US presidential election work?\n\nThe winner is not the person who gets the most votes across the country. Instead, both candidates compete to win contests held across the 50 states. Each state has a certain number of so-called electoral college votes partly based on population. There are a total of 538 up for grabs, and the winner is the candidate that wins 270 or more. All but two states have a winner-takes-all rule, so whichever candidate wins the highest number of votes is awarded all of the state's electoral college votes. Most states lean heavily towards one party or the other, so the focus is usually on a dozen or so states where either of them could win. These are known as the battleground or swing states. It is possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still be defeated by the electoral college.\n\nWho else is being elected?\n\nAll of the attention will be on who wins the presidency, but voters will also be choosing new members of Congress - where laws are passed - when they fill in their ballots. Congress consists of the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats are up for election, and the Senate, where 34 seats are being contested. Republicans currently control the House, which initiates spending plans. Democrats are in charge of the Senate, which votes on key appointments in government. These two chambers pass laws and can act as a check on White House plans if the controlling party in either chamber disagrees with the president.\n\nWhen do we know who has won the election?\n\nUsually a winner is declared on the night of the election, but in 2020 it took a few days to count all the votes. The period after the election is know as the transition if there is a change of president. It's a time for the new administration, including cabinet ministers, to form and make plans for the new term. The president is officially sworn into office in January in a ceremony known as the inauguration, held on the steps of the Capitol building in Washington DC.\n\nWho can vote?"

      "text": "RFK Jr, Jill Stein, Cornell West: Who else is running for president in 2024?\n\nGetty Images Independent and third-party candidates are unlikely to win, but could have a significant impact on he 2024 race.\n\nNone is on a realistic path to the White House, but the most well-known threaten to siphon away support from the Democratic and Republican candidates. Here are the people with the greatest potential to disrupt the race.\n\nRobert F Kennedy Jr\n\nGetty Images Some polls show RFK Jr drawing a substantial portion of the vote in a three-way match-up\n\nA former environmental lawyer known for his anti-vaccine activism, the nephew of former President John Kennedy initially sought - and failed - to run as a Democrat. The 70-year-old then mounted an independent challenge to what he called the \"two-headed monster\" of American politics, At least 15 of his relatives endorsed Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race. \"The Democrats are frightened that I'm going to spoil the election for President Biden. The Republicans are frightened that I'm going to spoil it for President Trump,\" he said at the time. \"The truth is, they're both right.\" During his campaign, Mr Kennedy has been criticised for repeating debunked conspiracy theories, such as a connection between childhood vaccines and autism, and for once likening Covid vaccine mandates to Nazi Germany. His latest controversy is perhaps the most wacky story of any campaign - his video admission to comedian Roseanne Barr that he once dumped a bear carcass in Central Park.\n\nHis populist economic message and criticism of the two major parties initially gave him a boost in the polls, on the back of the many disaffected voters unhappy with the choice of Biden or Trump. He narrowly missed qualifying for the first presidential debate in late June. But with Ms Harris in the race he has seen his popularity drop to single digits.\n\nJill Stein\n\nGetty Images Some Democrats believe Jill Stein's 2016 bid helped propel Donald Trump to victory\n\nThe activist and doctor ran as the Green Party's candidate in 2012 and 2016. Now back at 74 years old, she recently told BBC Americast that \"Americans are not voting for a candidate they like... They're generally voting against the candidate they hate the most. \"And that's no way for a democracy to function.\" Ms Stein calls for an \"economic bill of rights\" that would include universal access to healthcare and a right to employment. She also vows to fight climate change, defend abortion access and transgender rights, and was recently arrested at a student protest on behalf of Gaza. She is unlikely to get more than 2% of the vote - but that could still play spoiler to Ms Harris. Hillary Clinton supporters partly blame her for the Democrat's narrow defeat in 2016. In three critical states, Mrs Clinton lost to Mr Trump by fewer votes than Ms Stein received. According to the party's website, Ms Stein will be on the ballot in at least 20 states. She has yet to announce a running mate.\n\nCornel West\n\nGetty Images Cornel West's campaign has focused on a socialist platform\n\nThe 70-year-old activist and well-known academic has a complicated presidential bid. He launched it in June with the People's Party. After falling out with the group, Mr West said he would seek the Green Party's nomination, but then changed course to run as an independent. His socialist platform includes funding public healthcare and slashing the US defence budget. Melina Abdullah, a member of the board of directors of the Black Lives Matter Grassroots organisation, is his running mate. He has attacked Mr Biden as a \"war criminal\" and Mr Trump as a \"fascist pied piper\".\n\nHis candidacy could be a threat to Ms Harris in crucial swing states like Michigan, although he is currently on the ballot in only six states and has struggled to raise money.\n\nChase Oliver\n\nGetty Images The Libertarian Party nominated Chase Oliver over Mr Trump and Mr Kennedy\n\nThe Libertarian Party - the third biggest political party in the country - has nominated Chase Oliver as their presidential candidate, with Mike ter Maat as his running mate. In doing so, they spurned Mr Trump and Mr Kennedy, both of whom spoke at the party's convention this month in a bid for its support. Mr Trump received a notably unfriendly reception and lashed out at the audience during his speech. Mr Oliver, an openly gay sales executive who previously ran on the Libertarian ticket for US congressional races in Georgia, says voters are done with picking from \"the lesser of two evils\". \"I'm just about to be the age of 40. I'm living the life of a normal American,\" he recently told BBC Americast. \"I understand what it's like to go to the grocery store with the same amount of money but seeing less and less filling up the cart. Those are things that Donald Trump and Joe Biden are so far-removed from that they just can't communicate those values anymore.\""
