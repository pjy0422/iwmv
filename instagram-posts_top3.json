Challengers have cited the U.S. Constitution’s 14th Amendment, Section 3, which prohibits anyone who engaged in insurrection from holding the office of president. President Abraham Lincoln was not removed from general election ballots in 1860. At that time, political parties distributed their own ballots, which were single-party tickets, and some slaveholding states in the South did not print and hand out Republican ballots because there was little support for Lincoln in those places.

            "Justification": "Experts and public health officials say pesticides sprayed in New York City and other cities to combat mosquitoes pose no danger to humans because of the small amount of the chemicals used. The main ingredients in pesticides used by New York City are \"not likely\" to cause cancer in humans, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An ingredient in two of the pesticides was tied to benign tumors in animals, but there’s no evidence it causes cancer in humans. New York City’s health department said there have been no reported diseases in people or pets as a result of its mosquito spraying, which has been happening since 2001.",

A group of prominent conservatives examined 64 cases brought by Trump and his allies and found that 30 included a hearing on the case’s merits. Trump and his allies won only one case, and it involved too few votes to impact the results, the group found.",
