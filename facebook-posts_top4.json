Protesters were pepper-sprayed, tear-gassed and doused with water in freezing temperatures. There is no evidence to suggest planes sprayed poisonous chemicals over the protesters’ camps. People who participated in the protests and officials have refuted these claims. The claims seem to stem from news of a private rancher’s illegal use of the rodenticide Rozol in 2016 in the same vicinity as the protests, in an attempt to kill prairie dogs. Researchers and state officials who studied the incident found no link to the protests or protester illnesses.",
