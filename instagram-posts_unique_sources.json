Once it was clear someone had summoned a medic, Ivey amplified the call for help and gestured to where help was needed. He kept gesturing until it was confirmed aid was provided.",

Because the camera was pointing up at Biden, it made him look taller. In the video, Biden was standing a few steps in front of first lady Jill Biden, making him appear bigger because he was closer to the camera. In another photo from that day, the Bidens were standing beside each other, and their height difference was less exaggerated.",

It held its presidential primary earlier this year, on March 12. President Joe Biden won Washington’s Democratic presidential primary in March, according to the certified election results. Biden has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Under Washington law, presidential candidates must be certified for the November ballot by Aug. 20, which falls before the Democratic nominee could be formally elected at the Democratic National Convention. Washington’s secretary of state will accept a letter from the Democratic National Committee attesting to the party’s alternate nominee, a spokesperson said.",

        "Justification": "The Fairness Doctrine applied to broadcast licensees only, not cable networks. It required broadcast stations to \"afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance.\" The Federal Communications Commission eliminated the rule in 1987 amid a changing and more diverse media landscape. Democrats in the House and Senate tried to pass a law to keep it intact, but President Ronald Reagan vetoed it, saying he felt the policy was \"antagonistic\" to First Amendment protections. Although some people argue that the Fairness Doctrine’s elimination shifted the media landscape, it never applied to cable networks and, according to a Congressional Research Services analysis, would not be applied constitutionally to cable or satellite service providers.",

All four mice infected with GX_P2V died in the experiment, but the researchers said this result doesn’t apply to humans. The researchers did not create the GX_P2V coronavirus.

A translated version of Kim’s speech did not include the words, \"Biden,\" \"Trump,\" \"Israel,\" \"Palestine,\" \"Russia,\" \"Ukraine,\" or \"Taliban.\" Russia’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine and Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel had not yet happened. Kim mentioned that international sanctions had created challenges for North Koreans, but he did not call out the U.S. specifically in his Oct. 10, 2020, speech, according to news reports.",

Officials say none of that money has been disbursed to Iran and is intended for humanitarian purposes.",

The video in the post misrepresents a recent study that used cow’s milk molecules to stabilize mRNA to inject into mice and elicit an immune response. The research didn’t show, as the clip claims, that mRNA can be ingested via milk and cross the gastrointestinal barrier into the bloodstream. Chances are minuscule that mRNA vaccines could transfer to people who consume food products from vaccinated animals, experts said. Messenger RNA breaks down quickly, and federal rules don't allow for meat or milk to be harvested from animals until recent vaccines have been metabolized.",

If passed, the bill would not guarantee a TikTok ban, although lawmakers have raised national security concerns about the social media platform. A virtual private network, or VPN, provides an encrypted connection over the internet from a device to a network. This connection allows for the transmission of sensitive data by preventing unauthorized people from eavesdropping on the traffic. Senate Bill 686 does not criminalize possession of a VPN. But some experts are concerned that the bill, if passed, would impose criminal penalties for using a virtual private network to access TikTok if the app is banned. However, the legislation does not mention \"virtual private networks\" or \"VPNs\" and the bill sponsors said the legislation’s criminal provisions are aimed at corporations and executives, not individuals.",

Researchers were not directed to create a vaccine that caused permanent sterilization. An obstetrics and gynecology clinical professor told PolitiFact that pregnancy prevention is temporary and reversible. In contrast, sterilization is permanent and irreversible.",

        "Truth-O-Meter": "Mostly False",
        "Justification": "During an interview with the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, Ray Epps said he walked to the Capitol and told others to do the same. Epps texted his nephew at 2:12 p.m. Jan. 6 and said, \"I was in the front with a few others. I also orchestrated it.\" But when questioned about it in testimony to the select committee, Epps said he wrote this out of pride and that it was the wrong word choice in retrospect. He did not confess to Congress that he orchestrated the attack. Epps said when the scene became violent, he told people to remain peaceful. Epps did not go inside the Capitol, and he is not among more than 950 defendants charged with crimes related to Jan. 6.",

The National Voter Registration Act prevents election officials from removing people from voter rolls too quickly — even when they have reason to believe that a person has moved away. Those voters are classified as \"inactive voters\" while they remain on the rolls in accordance with federal law. Even if the total of active, pending and inactive voters outnumber eligible voters in some counties and states, that is not proof that ineligible voters are voting.",

Florida law allows for early processing of mail-in ballots and, in many counties in the state, machines speed up the processing of those ballots. In Arizona, where mail-in voting has been widely used since the 1990s, record numbers of mail ballots were dropped off at polling places on Election Day and those ballots take time to manually process.

The video the panelist showed features the same content as a video that was linked to a voter intimidation and influence campaign that took place from August to November 2020, a U.S. Attorney’s Office spokesperson said. The 2020 video was a simulation and does not depict the fraudulent creation of real ballots, according to a 2021 indictment. The federal government charged two Iranian nationals who created the video with breaking federal laws related to voter intimidation.",

        "Justification": "A preprint paper posted Oct. 20 suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was synthetic, not naturally occurring.

After that, an abortion is allowed only if the mother’s life or health are in danger.

There is no scientific basis for excluding from the death count COVID-19 deaths that occurred in nursing homes.

Currently, flu, HPV and COVID-19 vaccinations are not on that list. COVID-19 vaccinations have yet to be approved for children under the age of 12. Once they are approved for younger children, it’s unclear whether California will require schoolchildren to get the shot. If officials decide to mandate it, a personal belief exemption may or may not apply. If state health officials make that declaration, a personal belief exemption would apply under Senate Bill 277.

A separate measure of vaccine efficacy was the subject of a Lancet Microbe commentary — not a peer-reviewed study.

Furthermore, experts say that it is flawed and misleading to use these figures to calculate a death rate and compare it to the unvaccinated population. The post also claims that more than 7,000 people who have been fully vaccinated have become infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. That's true —the CDC has actually received more than 9,000 reports of vaccine breakthrough infections.

The $16 million figure isn’t just based on California income taxes. It also includes estimated payroll and federal income taxes. Although $16 million is a reasonable estimate of Lance’s take-home pay given current tax rates, it is still just an educated guess. Tax experts say that number could be influenced by a variety of factors, such as how Lance’s income is spread out over time, whether he accepts any endorsement deals and whether he chooses to donate to charity.",
