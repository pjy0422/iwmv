Although a cause of death has not been publicly reported, Jackson Lee said in June that she had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. We searched using Google and Nexis and found no reliable news reports connecting Jackson Lee's death to Secret Service oversight work or the Trump rally shooting. During July 22 congressional testimony, then-Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle offered lawmakers condolences for Jackson Lee’s death. That sparked claims linking Jackson Lee’s death to oversight of the U.S. Secret Service.",

In 1997, he was found liable for their deaths in a civil trial. Simpson maintained his innocence in the case and we found no reputable reports that he posted a confession on X before his death.
