In a 2015 poll of 70 countries based on population data on births and deaths and, where available, estimated rates of religious conversion, the Pew Research Center found that 31% of the world’s population was Christian and 24.1% was Muslim.

The report laid out a plan of phasing in those hires over 10 years. It was a plan; it did not represent a final decision of how congressional funding would be spent.• The federal government will not impose any income taxes on canceled student debt.

A University of Chicago research group that has examined 900 people charged to date has found no evidence of antifa involvement in the day's events. A video captured amid the attack does not show antifa; it shows a group of pro-Trump rioters, including some whose support for former President Donald Trump has been documented in charging documents, discussing the Capitol’s layout after breaching it.",

Studies that evaluated racial disparities in ADHD diagnoses found that Black children were less — not more — likely to get diagnosed with ADHD compared with white children displaying similar behavior. There is evidence that ADHD is being overdiagnosed among the entire population of children. But misdiagnoses occur because of a lack of trained professionals, a researcher said.",

More than 10 items were duplicates, factually incorrect or did not appear to have happened at all. Fifty incidents involved thousands of chickens or turkeys being killed because they were exposed to a highly contagious avian influenza. More than 15 items on the list were fires that officials said weren’t suspicious. Experts in fire research and avian influenza said the list’s legitimate incidents do not demonstrate that there is an ongoing effort to create food shortages.",

Energy analysts said that the notion that the U.S. has been paying $105 per barrel for Russian oil probably isn’t too far off, though it’s hard to pinpoint. In general, prices were going up throughout January and February, so the U.S. was paying more for all oil imports, not just those from Russia. The current, higher prices are largely attributable to Russia’s war in Ukraine and to a sluggish response to energy demands after the pandemic slowdown.",

Although squalene is used in some vaccines as an immune booster, it’s not utilized in any of the nine COVID-19 vaccines currently in use across the globe. Though an advocacy group warned that half a million sharks could be in jeopardy if COVID-19 vaccines used the squalene, The New York Times analyzed that figure and found it to be dependent on too many variables to be verified.",

The common cold is a catchall that refers to the mild respiratory illness that can be caused by several different viruses, including some seasonal coronaviruses that are separate and less serious than the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. There is still much to learn about the omicron variant. That it shows up in COVID-19 testing is one indicator that it is distinct from other viruses that cause the common cold.",

Posters used the graph to suggest COVID-19 vaccinations are harming children. They also criticizedCalifornia’s plans for a new vaccination mandate, which will require eligible schoolchildren to receive the shot once it gains full FDA approval. But health experts say VAERS data is voluntarily submitted and includes unverified information. An increase in reports doesn’t necessarily mean vaccinations are to blame for adverse events, especially since vaccinations are subject to rigorous testing before being rolled out to additional age groups. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionhas previously cautionedthat VAERS results are not enough to determine whether a vaccine is harmful.",

        "Justification": "Posts on social media claim there are more than 50 cargo freighters anchored off of the California coast. The posts suggest this will lead to nationwide food and supply shortages. Some of the posts also claim that the cargo boats are not being allowed to dock and unload, as part of a \"manufactured supply-chain halt.\" It is correct that there is a record-breaking number of ships at anchor in Southern California waiting to unload their cargo, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California. But experts say that the backup is being caused by labor shortages, holiday buying surges and other COVID-19 related issues. Experts say that supply-chain disruptions and some product shortages are to be expected as the world continues to navigate a global pandemic.",

According to experts, the CDC chose to withdraw its EUA request because it wanted to direct laboratories and testing facilities to use a protocol that tests for multiple viruses at once, not just the COVID virus, to save time and resources as flu season approaches.",

Fried suspended gun permits for about two dozen people charged with crimes in connection to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Due to a privacy law for permit holders, we do not know the specific charges against them. Charges against riot participants that day include obstruction of law enforcement, violence with a deadly weapon, assault, and unlawful possession of a firearm on Capitol grounds. Permit holders who receive a notice about a suspension can request a hearing.",

A diesel generator was used in an experiment to power an electric car charging station.

The alert asked Californians to conserve electricity when possible. It included several tips, including a suggestion to avoid charging electric cars during peak power usage hours. Most electric car drivers top off their battery regularly rather than charging it from empty to full. Therefore, many cars are equipped with charging timers and require only a few hours of charging each day, so Californians can easily avoid charging vehicles during peak hours. Experts say California’s power grid can comfortably support up to 5 million electric cars on the road. Currently, there are about 635,000 electric vehicles registered in the state, according to the California Energy Commission.",

A medical examiner found high levels of fentanyl in his system, but experts in toxicology, cardiology and drug use stated death by overdose was unlikely or impossible.

Slow vaccine uptake can cause more variants, since the virus continually looks to evolve and escape any immunity — natural or vaccine-induced.

Jenner has also received criticism for a fatal car accident that prompted her to pay settlements. Posts across Facebook and Twitter have suggested that Jenner recklessly killed someone in the streets. In 2015, Jenner was involved in the accident where she rear-ended a car into oncoming traffic, which caused the driver’s death. Jenner settled with several of the parties. However, the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department suggested Jenner be charged for vehicular manslaughter. After an investigation, the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s office found there was no evidence to support whether Jenner was negligent or had broken any major traffic laws. Legal experts say proving these types of cases is difficult because the burden of proof relies solely on the prosecutor.",

In a statement to PolitiFact, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Chauvin \"is the same person the world has seen on video, in the courtroom and being led away in handcuffs to the maximum security prison at Oak Park Heights.\" \"False flag\" conspiracy theories regularly claim that major news events were staged or did not happen.

In a party-line vote, the Democratic-led House of Representatives changed its rules document to replace gender-specific references with neutral ones.

The Congressional Budget Office does not have a cost estimate for the impeachment resolution. The $33-million figure appears to stem from an inaccurate report on the costs of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation, which has nothing to do with Trump’s second impeachment. Trump’s second impeachment likely did not cost taxpayers much beyond what was already budgeted. Congressional salaries and other institutional costs are built into the budget; there were no witnesses who traveled to Washington; and taxpayers did not cover legal fees.",

That makes it difficult for researchers to create a vaccine that can address them all. Governments around the world have invested in companies to help speed up a COVID-19 vaccine.

        "Truth-O-Meter": "Mostly False",
        "Justification": "Experts said a penalty of $10,000 in one year would have been extremely unlikely because it would have meant the family’s income would have been in the $400,000 range. In that income bracket, the family would likely have been able to afford health insurance. President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in 2017 zeroed out the penalty for not having health insurance, known as the individual mandate. Before the individual mandate was undone, this penalty was collected like any other tax, so it went directly into the federal Treasury. Therefore, it may or may not have been directly used to fund health insurance subsidies. Subsidies reduce the cost of insurance; they do not make it free.",

        "Main Claim": "“Kamala Harris Tried to Put Pro-Lifers in Jail Who Exposed Planned Parenthood Selling Baby Parts”",
        "Truth-O-Meter": "False",
        "Justification": "Popular Facebook posts claimed Kamala Harris tried to put \"pro-lifers\" in jail who \"exposed Planned Parenthood selling baby parts.\" Planned Parenthood denied the accusations. Staffers in unedited videos discussed covering costs for the legal donation of fetal tissue for medical research. A dozen states investigated Planned Parenthood after edited videos released by anti-abortion activists accused it of illegally selling fetal tissue. No criminal findings were ever made for that activity. While Harris was California attorney general, her agency investigated the anti-abortion activists. They were charged with violating state privacy laws after Harris left for the U.S. Senate.",

Some said offenders who had sex with minors as young as 11 would not be placed on the state’s sex offender registry. Those claims are both false. In reality, the California Legislature passed a bill that aims to eliminate automatic sex offender registration mainly for LGBTQ young adults. Instead, a judge would decide whether to register for life those convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. The bill does not reduce the standards for statutory rape. Existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders on the registry in cases involving vaginal intercourse. The bill in question only applies to young people ages 14, 15, 16 or 17 and any offender within a 10 year age range.",

We found that part about the postal service is correct. But we also found that some states allow far more time to receive a mail-in ballot than others.

Microbe plushies representing a number of diseases are widely available for sale. The Event 201 plushies were not intended to commemorate the toll that the coming outbreak would bring.
